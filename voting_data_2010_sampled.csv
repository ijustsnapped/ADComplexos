Nsk92,Connormah,-1,-1,2010,"06:07, 14 July 2010","'''Oppose''' (mv from Neutral) On closer inspection, I am unimpressed with the answers. Answers to Q9 (see my older cmnts in Neutral) and Q8 in particular show wobbliness.  The answer to Q8 is really unsatisfactory. As an admin, you have a responsibility to act, and to act quickly, if you see obvious and continuous disruption, such as somebody CSD tagging [[United States of America]], [[Wii]] and [[March]]. You issue a quick warning and if that does not help, you block the user. As an admin, your first priority should be to stop ongoing disruption rather than worry that you might be insufficiently nice to an established user. Do that, and then post to AN/I and wherever to check if the account has been compromised or what.  NuclearWarfare and Decltype also raise important point. I don't expect every RfA candidate to have a bunch of FAs/GAs, but the content that you do create needs to be brought up to par, especially in BLP cases. I have looked up, at random, at one of the articles you created, [[Dan Tencer]]. The first ref in this article is currently a deadlink to a Facebook(!) page. Also, for this BLP article more than a year ago you uploaded an image File:Dan Tencer.jpg, downloaded from a Twitter page and missing copyright permissions. When somebody finally tagged the image as CSD F9 in March 2010, you woke up and filed an OTRS ticket request. I am not sure what exactly is going on there, but you did not follow up: the ticket, apparently, could not be resolved, went stale, and the file is still missing a copyright permission several months later (and has been tagged for deletion again). You need to be more pro-active in mopping up these kinds of problems and not let them drag on for ages."

Her answers to questions (above) also show a good level of understanding. Many of the objections raised below by opposers do not carry much weight. The comment at the AfD was not entirely unreasonable. Lack of article writing experience is given far too much importance these days in RfAs. The removals of the PROD were more significant, but presumably she knows better now, and not even admins are perfect. The concern about being too busy is totally irrelevant: an admin who has little time to work here does no harm, and may do a little good. I believe she will make a good admin."

I absolutely disagree with most of the ""oppose"" rationale here: I have no problem with an editor who only does vandal fighting also handle AIV backlogs; I don't want to discourage users who like vandal fighting from doing what they like. And this editor has done a tremendous amount of great work fighting vandals - as someone who doesn't really do a whole lot of vandal fighting I am extremely grateful to Falcon8765 and others who do that kind of work; the project would be much worse off without it. I think a critical component of fighting vandals is to distinguish between the ""obvious vandals"" and the misguided good-faith editors, and it is particularly important for admins to be able to make this distinction. An example of a mistake in this area, I think, is [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:68.236.155.129&diff=380867179 here] - the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akahi_Nui?diff=380867169 edit in question] was not vandalism.

I also have concerns about a potential Admin who states he is ""hazy"" on policy and cannot trust himself with some of the tools.

For the second question the candidate offers WP:REDIRECT as a stronger alternative to WP:CROSS which would be more compelling absent any other essays or guidelines touching on the issue but there are others so this seems selective if understandable citation of Wikipedia help files.  Also the dismissal of the usefulness criterion seems groundless.  The usefulness criterion was given as much space as the cross-namespace item. If it only applies in 1% of cases what is it then?  A sop?  A bone to be handed out to quell worries of naive inexperienced XfD participants before the upcoming article execution?  What is that 1% theoretical case where it would qualify as a legitimate reason to keep?  To answer the candidate's question: Is the question trappy?  Yes. But it is a tricky real example selected with a purpose. As a real example there are other dimensions to the episode to consider.  In your answer to question 2 you say investigation and analysis is a strength of yours.  I was hoping to see an example of it in this case.

I have not yet had time to look at the candidate's contrib record in detail, but I do remember one encounter with him from less than a month ago which raises some red flags. This concerns [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Richard Wagner's first love]] and the related AN/I thread [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive633#Organizing AfD comments]]. Basically, Torchwoodwho decided that it was a good idea to re-arrange the AfD comments into ""keep""/""delete""/""other"" sections and started moving around the AfD comments of other users accordingly. When it was pointed out to him that this went against well established conventions, he took the matter to the AN/I and started the above mentioned AN/I thread. At AN/I it was explained to him that what he was doing was both against a well established convention and against [[WP:AFDEQ]] which says: ""Do not reorder comments on the deletion page to group them by keep/delete/other. Such reordering can disrupt the flow of discussion, polarize an issue, and emphasize vote count or word count."" To be fair, Torchwoodwho was certainly motivated by the desire to improve the process and after the AN/I comments by others he quickly conceded the point and was perfectly nice about it. Still, to me the episode demonstrates a lack of experience and understanding of how the AfD process works. There is a place for being bold, but with something like a significant revision of an AfD format he really should have asked first, say at [[WT:AFD]]. As it was, he created a bit of a mess in the Wagner AfD, which had to be untangled."

JamesBWatson,Jerem43,-1,-1,2010,"10:56, 7 December 2010","'''Oppose''' Unfortunately there are numerous indications that this user is unclear about various areas of policies and procedures. Also, several of the answers to  questions are too general, and avoid really indicating what the candidate's views are, in some cases leaving me wondering if they have any views. For example, the response to question 5 doesn't answer ""When should you block a user who was received no warnings?"" Yes, it says that ""It would require a truly, blatantly wrong act or serious infraction"", but it gives absolutely no indication whatsoever what the candidate thinks would be such a ""truly, blatantly wrong act or serious infraction"". Presumably we all know that it would have to be something serious, but to me the question is asking for an indication of specifically what would be serious enough, and the candidate makes no attempt at all to tell us. The answer to question 4 suggests a readiness to unblock by default ""unless there was a distinct pattern of vandalism in the history"". I would certainly want to ask the user requesting the unblock for further information than just ""I will be good in future"". Also, while ""If the address were a shared address from a school"" then the candidate is right to ""encourage him/her to create an account"", but wrong to think that one should, in general, also unblock for the whole school. I am also not sure about unblocking ""unless there was a distinct pattern of vandalism in the history"". If there was no pattern of vandalism then why was the IP blocked in the first place? The answer to question 9 suggests a lack of clarity as to the distinction between a ban and a block. Yes, I accept that it is possible to make a slip and use the wrong word, but (1) the question asked about banning, and to say ""oh, I was answering the question as though it meant blocking, and only wrote 'ban' by a slip"" is really not good enough. Also, ""ban"" appears three times in the answer, which seems unlikely unless the candidate is not really all that clear about the difference. An admin should be 100% clear about those two being different concepts. The candidate indicates an interest in playing an administrative role in ANI, but admits to having taken very little part there hitherto. Watching and not taking part is helpful, but does not provide any evidence as to how the candidate would perform there. Likewise the candidate indicates an interest in playing an administrative role in AIV, but I can find very little vandalism-related work in the candidate's edit history. My experience of working at AIV indicates that even among experienced Wikipedians there are many who have quite mistaken ideas about how AIV is to be used, and it is essential that ''every'' admin who works there has a thorough grasp of procedure. Those are just a few samples of my concerns, and unfortunately there are many others, several of which have already been discussed above by others. (e.g. the answer to Question 6, and doubts about the candidate's temperament.) Some of the concerns are fairly minor, but there are just too many of them. My overall feeling is that the candidate is rather vague about the whole question of what being an administrator involves. It's a pity, because we are dealing with an editor with many strong points, but unfortunately some weaknesses in areas which are of great importance to admin work."

There are two reasons that new editors can show competence, either they read the copious documentation that has been provided for how to edit wikipedia, or they are exercising a [[WP:CLEANSTART]].  Neither of those reasons should be a problem.  If a clean start is so clean that one cannot say who the original account was, who cares?  Clearly the user has remedied whatever deficiency lead him or her to leave the project.  If the user is someone who has read the manual, then they are exactly the sort of user we want contributing to the project and as an administrator, not someone to discourage with allegations of sockpuppetry merely for showing competence.

Initially it was only the lack of activity outside of antivandalism work that put me off, although I'm convinced that you have enough article development experience to at least show competence there. What pushed me to oppose were the sparse answers to questions above. For someone who is essentially focused on protecting Wikipedia from troublemakers, the answer to question 4 was a huge disappointment and alone would cause me to oppose. Personal threats (of the non-legal kind), obvious sockpuppetry, breaking 3RR after being warned once, violating a topic ban or other sanction, there are numerous reasons to block a person before they received the usual 4 escalated warnings and I think that your answer demonstrates your lack of experience outside of the narrow focus of vandal-fighting, even in regards to other forms of disruption. The answer to the next question (IAR) is nearly as disappointing; I didn't understand IAR (I thought it was ridiculous) until I'd had a better understanding of Wikipedia in general and I consider it a very good indicator of a person's experience. The next question is also a problem; despite the sockpuppetry, the good-faith edits might indicate that the person ''isn't'' just a vandal, and so perhaps the original indef block could be overturned, it would be best to try to engage the editor before taking further action (they might also not know about block evasion and sockpuppetry rules). The answer to 7 was correct, I have no issues with that, but the answer to 8 was lacking substance (though there's not much I'd object to in what you said). Overall I see that you're lacking experience, and I don't have a problem with you in general but I think you'd benefit greatly from participation outside of the Huggle/Anti-Vandal/Recent Changes arena.

After reading the Oppose opinions, looking at your edit history, reviewing the requirements for administration privileges, I have to come down on the side of support. Your edit count is low, when compared to a user that who utilizes automated tools.  However, all your edits where done manually.  This shows me that you take the time  to review what you are doing and I can find no technical faults with your edits other than ones based on opinion, such as the one pointed out by [[User:Colonel Warden| Colonel Warden]] and question 9  Both clearly an opinion call, unless we call in the Wikilawyers, and there I guareentee you, it would be a split decision.  Overall, I find your edits clearly a net positive that far outweigh any negatives expressed so far.   I trust this will carry over to the availabilty of those extra buttons.

If he's rolled back ""far more edits than [he] can count"", but has only made at most 5 AIV reports then he either misunderstands what vandalism is, or misunderstand AIV. Over a six year period that isn't a lot at all. From a content point of view, well, five new articles in six years isn't what I'd expect. I'd like to see more experience ''at the coal face'' before giving anyone a promotion. I counted ten months, out of the last 70, where the user made more than 100 edits per month, i.e. more than four a day. The activity levels just aren't high enough. We need someone who's around, in touch and contributing.

HJ Mitchell,Bsadowski1,-1,1,2010,"01:05, 23 July 2010","'''Oppose'''. I'm sorry, but you don't appear to have ''any'' substantial edits. You have more edits to your own userpage than you do to your own talk page or any article or, for that matter, any discussion page in any namespace. Further, your activity seems to have peaked in the middle of last year and has only started to increase from <100 edits per month recently. I'm not convinced that you have the practical, ""hands on"" knowledge of policy and current practice at places like AIV and RfPP that can only be acquired by experience. Further, I don't see any evidence that you've ever played a substantial part in ''any'' discussion of either content or policy. This is what pushes me into the oppose section, I'm afraid. The vast majority of admin tasks require interpreting consensus in some form or another and I'm afraid I just can't trust you to deal with that with only a theoretical understanding. Finally, I'd add, that while I feel strongly about this, absolutely none of it should be taken slightingly- if you took the feedback and got more involved and more experienced, I could easily support a future RfA."

Incidently, I disagree with your reply to one of the neutrals below - ""I could reapply in seven years and the same links would be presented"" - they could well be presented in future RfAs, but if your behaviour/attitude is different in the few months beforehand, I would expect most editors to basically say ""that was then, but it doesn't apply now"". Looking through the RfA archives, you can find many examples of people who applied at RfA a couple of times, and got it after that because they had shown that they listened to the comments and responded in a positive way. If you can do that, then perhaps there is hope for a future RfA - if you can't, then there is no hope. -- '''''"

I did indeed ""tactfully ignore"" (as Courcelles aptly puts it) your second RfA, and have tried to do the same here. However, something is niggling me which I can't ignore and neither can I sit on the fence with it. I believe you have the commitment to the project, I don't think ''anyone'' can deny that, and I have no doubt you will make it in the end, but it's just the sense of urgency you seem to have about getting ''There'' – this mythically positioned place in the echelons of Wikipedia. It's not just the fact that this is only one month after your second RfA, it's your ''third'' in 6 months and 3 weeks – the time it, arguably, takes for just one to come and go. Now, I think this is because you have become very good friends and colleagues with your nominators Wehwalt and HJ Mitchell, for whom, I stress, I have the greatest respect, and you maybe feel you are missing out on something if you are not a fully-fledged member of The Club. I don't really see in your contributions a need for the tools. In your second RfA, you were opposed on the grounds of content contribution versus vandalism fighting. So, in your third RfA you have worked on the content contribution (for a month), but seemingly forgotten what it is the tools are for. Now, I know that may seem like a ""FFS! Damned if I do, damned if I don't!"" situation, but it is all about balance. And consistency. If you are Vandalbane the Great or Sherlock Sockpuppet, have little content creation to speak of, but I often find myself blocking or deleting on your behalf, I will support you; if you are Mr GA 2010 but find it frustrating when someone has plonked a great big redirect where you want to move a more appropriately named article with a rich history, I will support. Or any mixture of the two is welcome. However, since this RfA started it seems you have avoided contact with anything and everything at all (apart from userspace article work) – this doesn't really tell us what you ''want'' or ''intend'' to do; only that you are perhaps scared to do anything in case it has an adverse effect on this Request.

Based on this RFA and my survey of the candidate's actions I'm comfortable with the candidate in this regard. My question 4 has somewhat derailed this RFA, I've had some involvement in Dashbot's program of gently chiding editors of unreferenced BLPs that they may have long forgotten, and when I asked the question I was hoping for the sort of answer that was one part of the candidate's reply - he no longer edits those articles because he considers himself to have a COI. I'd have been equally reassured with a response along the lines of ""I've changed musical tastes and no longer have access to the relevant reference material"". It is nice if editors help tidy up their earliest work, but I believe we should judge admin candidates on what they are capable of now. Weak because I suspect the candidate thinks that Adminship endows one with status or authority - a harmless attitude in a non-admin but not desirable in an Admin, also because of the adding of an unverifiable full name to a BLP.

I believe this will put others at ease (at least myself) as you can demonstrate Policy knowledge (building this also there) and that your not afraid to answer queries as well and deal with moments of stress for other editors. Addtionally your edits are consitant for a long period of time. But you range from about 10 to 100 edits a month, while you (others) argue quantity vs quality, I still think you need to double or even triple your involvment in the project. This can easily be done by branching out from Karate related articles (you could still contribute there) but you could also contribute in other areas as well. Same stories just different topics. Finally I would suggest for constructive feedback as well you consider [[Wikipedia: Editor Review]] after your RFA or down the road. You'll get alot of benefit from that I think.

Understands the need for edit summaries but  tends to  use the summaries as a substitute for article/user talk  page comment.  Very, very  low on  creations, which  are mostly  very  short stubs, or even unreferenced articles. Low traffic on  his talk  page and an annoyingly monthly  archiving of just  one or two  posts.  30% automated edits does not  demonstrate a solid knowledge of policy and significantly  reduces the real edit  count.

From what I've read of your articles and various reviews, it appears that you do the absolute minimum to get articles to GA or past DYK's 5x expansion rule. This is most often expressed in a comparatively long ""Design"" section (ex. [[French battleship Gaulois (1896)]]) where basic characteristics of a ship&mdash;often already available in the infobox or the [[ship class|class]] article&mdash;is restated in prose so that the article is long enough for DYK. In [[SMS Babenburg|other]] [[SMS Árpád|articles]], you have simply copied over a ''five''-paragraph-long design section and added a lead + two/three paragraphs on the ships' service lives. Yes, these articles technically meet the GA requirements, but they really aren't up to par IMHO.

There are still too many  Wikipedians who  believe their edit count  is a passport  to  adminship and that quantity  is far more important  than quality, I am not overly impressed by  the number of created stubs or their notability (or lack of it),  or the hig number of redirects counted as creations, or what  in my  opinion is a clear misunderstanding  of the system of classifying  articles as stub/start class etc. Admittedly  the candidate makes very  few semi-automated edits from  Twinkle or Friendly, but  that   assumes also that  welcoming  or warning  other contributors has  been low on  the priorities, as has, to judge from  the  ratio  of article space to  various talk  pages, his general  enthusiasm to  be part of the greater community, and to  be active in  a broader diversity  of topics.

As for knowing whether articles should or should not be deleted we can only judge them from their proven ability to create articles that don't get deleted. Many of us are used to judging candidates by their record of identifying what should be deleted, but that is to an extent the other side of the same coin. Looking through the candidate's contributions I did see the occasional reversion of vandalism, though without the follow through of warning the vandal. I noticed the concern about their large number of user space edits - but looking at those edits they are clearly article building in their sandbox before copying articles into mainspace. If this RFA fails, and I hope it doesn't, I  would suggest that in future when a draft is ready, moving if from sandbox into mainspace rather than copy pasting its contents into mainspace would prevent future misunderstandings of that nature.

When I talk and nobody listens about my belief that admin terms should expire, this is exactly the kind of situation I had in mind. For whatever reason, Wikipedia adminship does seem to have a peculiar moral corrosiveness of its own; after a while, it turns people who have always been perfectly reasonable into petty tyrants who think Wikipedia's rules apply to the little people and not to themselves. [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Herostratus 2/The Great Galoot Scare Of 2010|This page]] shows that not only does Herostratus not ""get it"" as to why people were getting upset with him, but that he genuinely believes Wikipedia policies are for other people and don't apply to him. (The reason you're ""banging your head against a wall trying to get people to understand that none of this is BLP violation"" is that you appear to be the only person on the whole project who believes it, regardless of your [[Wikipedia:Material concerning living persons in non-article space|attempt to retroactively rewrite the BLP policy]].)<br>Regarding ''""On [failing to adhere to the standard of decorum expected of administrators] I've served my sentence, in that I was taken to the woodshed by ArbCom, so why should I be punished again now?""'', in my opinion the fact that you're apparently treating this whole process as one big joke shows that the lesson clearly hasn't sunk in.

Like it or not, [[WP:NOBIGDEAL]] is a thing of the past and those 8,000 new editors joining each month ''do'' look to admins as role models; crap like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Herostratus&oldid=369756701#Origins_and_Early_Life this] is never going to be appropriate any more.

As far as I can tell you are an excellent Wikipedian.  Given the areas you have indicated you wish to work in, my only three criteria are (1) Will the nominee deliberately misuse the tools? (Absolutely no suggestion that you will), (2) Can the nominee demonstrate high-level skills in both avoiding and resolving conflicts with other editors? (Close enough; I'm happy with the answers you've given in that area), and (3) Does the nominee have a strong understanding of the policies relevant to their chosen areas of work?  It's (3) where I have a problem, in that your grasp on the speedy deletion criteria as evidenced by questions 5 and 6 does not appear to be strong.  Speedy deletions in general are only for the most blatantly uncontroversial deletions; the answers should either have been an unambiguous delete for well explained reasons in line with CSD policy, a declining of the CSD, or a referral to another admin for a second opinion.  Your answer to 6 - which I asked to give you a second chance at question 5, and must confess I don't have a definitive answer to myself - is certainly technically correct but I was hoping for an answer that demonstrated a deeper understanding of either the CSD policy or the processes and procedures of deletion.

I've seen a lot of good work in randomly trawling through edits, and I have no objection at all to somebody with a past record of creating stubby or incomplete articles - it can even be seen as making opportunities for other editors, as the first step is the toughest, and by creating an article that is good enough to survive new page patrol, you've got it ""over the hump"". On the other hand I cannot support the implication that ""''but I know it's true''"" trumps what the sources say; whch is not just an issue for BLPs, but for articles in general. Apart from the pure vandals, a lot of the folk who come here and make bad changes that get reverted ''genuinely believe'' what they're saying - they really believe that astrology makes useful predictions, or that xbox is vastly superior to PS3, or that political party X is way better than political party Y; and this is a problematic approach that should be addressed wherever it is found. Since we do not have a mechanism for ensuring that editors themselves are reliable sources, the only way to build encyclopaedic content is to build it on external reliable sources. On another point, I agree with UncleDouggie above, to an extent; I think that the candidate would have easily got the bit back by asking for it directly; it might be meaningful to say that the ""community"" scuppered this, but that's just the proximal cause and it seems to be widely acknowledged that RfA is tough these days - I think the root cause is the candidate setting higher standards for themself. Setting higher standards is often good, but we have to accept that there's a chance of failing to meet them (if there's ''no'' chance of failing to meet a toughened standard then there's something seriously wrong with the toughening).

Too many areas of concern that, taken individually, might be overlooked, but taken together they really add up. As, others have said, it would help if you invest more time and effort in content work (especially since in Q2 you list that as your best contributions to Wikipedia), write some articles from scratch, maybe some DYK and GA contributions, etc. Some of the answers to the policy questions are a bit wobbly and at least partially incorrect. As noted in oppose no.17, you also need to be more careful with rollback. Personally, I would like to see more AfD contributions, both in number and in substance, especially since in ansering Q1 you mention AfD as a planned area of admin work. I have looked through your contribution record for the last three months and I see only a handful of AfD's there, with fairly brief !votes. I'd like to see some less than straightforward AfDs, where you make a reasonably complicated and involved argument. Also, even your short AfD !votes could use some improvement. In these two recent AfDs, [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chris C. Kemp (2nd nomination)]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/SM Hypermarket]] you say things like ""Being NASA's web council chairman and CIO of NASA's research center appears to assert notabilty"" and ""As such, it asserts notability"" as arguments for ""keep"". There is a big difference between ''asserting'' notability and ''demonstrating'' notability. The former is usually sufficient for avoiding a CSD tag, but not for a ""keep"" decision in an AfD, where demonstrating notability is required. An admin closing an AfD often has to provide a well argued policy-based closing statement and stuff like ""appears to assert notability"" is just not going to fly there.  I'd suggest withdrawing this RfA, there is really no need to prolong it."

Herostratus, I hope that you will understand my viewpoint, and if this RfA should fail, I hope that you will endeavour to demonstrate more collegiate behaviour, and will apply for adminship again after appropritate time.

With a nod to [[WP:NOBIGDEAL]]. I have taken into account the support reasonings about no great harm being done to Wikipedia in the actions leading up to this, however, we would not factor in a 'lack of harm' when evaluating a non-admins RfA; we'd look at their recent edit history and conclude based upon that.

As for the BLP drama, this is a good example of how we are getting a bit too extremist with the whole BLP idea. I don't see what's the big deal about mentioning negative information about living people as long as it stays off our articles. BLP is an important policy ''for what we publish in our articles'' but outside our articles what is proper decorum should be left up to the much neglected [[WP:CIV]]. Anybody who reads over the AFD will clearly see that this is one editor's ''opinion'' of the subject and not a blanket statement put out by Wikipedia.   Most every other discussion-based website would permit remarks such as what Herostratus made without thinking twice about them.  Unless he goes and publishes these remarks within our articles I see no infraction of the intent behind the BLP policy. I also echo SMarshall's voice above about the lynch mob and BigDom about BLP.

Nick Ottery,White Shadows,-1,-1,2010,"12:40, 7 July 2010","'''Oppose''' I'm sorry to make my first contribution to RFA like this, but I am regretfully in the oppose camp on this one. I have come across White Shadows in a number of venues, mostly related to Did You Know where he puts in a lot of time and effort. Besides this I see from his contributions that he does a lot of anti-vandal work and his editing in the area of ships and submarines is laudable, even if, as Ed has pointed out above, the work is usually sufficient to just pass at DYK or GA. Overall his edits show a definite positive trend away from the blocks of his early career. However, I believe that this improvement was down to a number of respected editors (gently and not so gently) pushing White Shadows away from areas of drama, and encouraging him to spend more time building the encyclopedia. White Shadows, as Begoon says above, has a tendency to jump in ""feet first"", particularly when there is some sort of drama going on (besides the Tan incident mentioned above, this also manifests itself in his poor spelling which could easily be addressed if White Shadows paused for a minute or two to read back a comment, rather than rushing in and hitting the save button) and this leads to escalation of the situation and increasing conflict. By becoming an admin, White Shadows would be pushed back directly into the path of high drama, whether he wanted to be or not. An admin should <s>diffuse</s> defuse a situation, not make it worse, and this is where White Shadows would fall down. I believe that this will very quickly result in White Shadows getting into the same kind of trouble as earlier in the year. White Shadows is a promising editor but I think becoming an admin at this time is too early and would cause too many problems (both for WS and for en.wikipedia). tl;dr You are doing a good job and improving month on month. Focus on your content-related skills, improving the encyclopedia and working on ""looking before you leap"" and leave the distractions of adminship for another day."

Ironholds is a great contributor to this project and his article writing skills are without doubt making this project a better place. Sadly, his approach to speedy deletion is too aggressive in my opinion and shows an apparent lack of understanding when it comes to our [[WP:CSD|speedy deletion policy]]. I know he is very active at NPP and as such does thousands of taggings, which is commendable but if he approaches deletions the same way if this request passes, I fear it will lead to many incorrect deletions and thus to the [[WP:BITE|biting of a lot of newbies]]. To cite some examples (all within the last 4 days): [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Starseed_%28novel%29&diff=prev&oldid=335039046 A3 on article which had a infobox with non-trivial information] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stardance&diff=prev&oldid=335039019 twice]) ([[WP:CSD#A3]] explicitely excludes such articles), [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jordan_Media_City&diff=prev&oldid=335036852 A7 with claims of importance], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jane_McKechnie_Walton&diff=prev&oldid=335032181 A7 with multiple claims of importance], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allen_Technologies&diff=prev&oldid=335027034 A7 with claims of importance] ([http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22allen+technologies%22&btnG=Search&um=1&ned=us&num=100&hl=en and 190+ GNews hits]), [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ry%C5%ABhei_Tamura&diff=prev&oldid=335020971 A7 on manga artist where the manga has its own article and is award-winning], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=California_State_Association_of_Counties&diff=prev&oldid=334981671 G12 where copyvio could have been removed easily], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Institute_for_Research_on_Learning&diff=prev&oldid=334859538 A7 with claims of importance and reliable source], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Toronto_City_Summit_Alliance&diff=prev&oldid=334654714 A7 for organisation that initiated notable projects], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tensie_Whelan&diff=prev&oldid=334601969 G11 on non-spam article], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geoff_Apps&diff=prev&oldid=334593902 A7 with claims of importance]. Similarly, [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Golconda Express]] as mentioned by Colonel Warden above which currently has only ""keep"" !votes and which looks like Ironholds forgot [[WP:BEFORE]] also shows a skewed approach to deletion.

Then when you understand the ropes a bit better, think more about what you can actually do with admin tools and how you'd want to use them --"

I have long admired Alansohn's astonishingly prolific rate of DYK creation and his dedicated vandalism-patrolling work, but I have also encountered his sustained and bitter ABF personalisations of disagreements at XfD. Those lead me to conclude that Alansohn's undoubted strengths wrt content have not so far been mirrored by any remotely similar strengths in interaction with other editors, and skill at interaction is an essential part of adminship. I am impressed by the efforts which Alansohn has latterly made to avoid conflict, and he should be commended for that. However, this appears to have been done primarily by ''disengaging'' from discussion, rather than by developing a sustained pattern of more collaborative engagement, and episodes such as the [[Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2010 July 4|NYT DRV in July]] suggest that the combative persona may be dormant rather than reformed.<br />I hope that in time my concerns will prove to be unfounded, but the proof I would seek is of a sustained ability to routinely engage in civil discussions with editors over contentious matters, rather than simply avoiding points of contention.<br />In the meantime, I hope that Alansohn will not see a lack of support for adminship ''at this time'' as any sort of lack of respect for the real strengths which his commitment brings to Wikipedia in other ways. --"

TTTSNB,Bsadowski1,1,1,2010,"02:52, 22 July 2010","'''Strongest possible support''' The opposes do not convince me. Bsadowski1 has been immensely helpful on IRC when it comes to catching sockpuppets and the like. I think he is a great asset to the Wiki, and making him an administrator would only make that better. And, to counter Tiptoety's oppose below, I see asking other users for advice or help as a positive trait. I take it as a sign that '''he won't blindly rush into areas that he has little or no experience in.''' He will ask for help, and most likely take it slow if he wants to go into a different areas. And to counter the other opposes, I should point out that not all of us are writers. So what if he has only written a stub? Is learning the layout of articles, learning how to deal with disputes, learning the policies and guidelines without writing something that people are incapable of? (As a side note, I would say that vandal-fighting, cleanup, and maintenance have given me a very good view of how articles are made, sourced, debated about, etc.) I myself will attest that writing is not my best trait, but I do have my moments (like this one). Frankly everything that I would want to write about has... already been written about. A very large, simply massive amount of things have already been written about. The traits of the Wiki are beginning a transition more towards maintaining this collection of articles, and writing about recent events, and less about things that are already known. Why isn't the community's attitude reflecting that? The package of admin tools is descibed as the '''mop and bucket''', not the '''pen and paper'''. Denying administrators because they would rather maintain everything else that has been written rather than writing things themselves is, in my opinion, a silly notion. Maintenance... vandal-fighting... SPI work... it's a dirty job, but someone has to do it. And without the tools, we are very limited in the way that we can carry out those dirty jobs. The people who are already writing, and doing nothing but writing... let them write. It's the maintainers of this encyclopedia that need the tools, and I would say that Bsadowski1 is one of the best persons for the job. <font face=""Segoe Print"">"

But what I disagree with you is your statement ""since the admin acted appropriately by attempting to discuss the issue and removing unsourced content"". The admin acted in ''no way appropriately'', considering that [[WP:3RR|3RR]] is a policy and the admin should know better. The admin should have notified the IP of 3RR, ''stopped'' reverting once the IP violated it, and reported the IP to [[WP:AN3|AN3]] to let an uninvolved user assess the situation. Pulling the ""it was vandalism"" card is clearly unjustified, as the content was not potentially harmful BLP material.

You had a chance to discuss the possible relevance of [[WP:NOTNEWS]] and/or [[WP:NOTPAPER]], to demonstrate that multiple sources meeting [[WP:RS]] are available (I [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2010_United_States_tomato_shortage&diff=391752024&oldid=391552943 added some] from ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' & ''[[The Republican (Springfield)|The Republican]]'', for example), and prehaps a chance to offer possible merge or expansion ideas (some of which are under discussion at the article's [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/2010 United States tomato shortage|AfD]]).

But if we were to turn RFA from a discussion about whether an editor can be trusted with the tools to a WikiPolitics election about their view on policy development then I think it would be bad for the site, both in terms of the way we choose admins and the way we develop policy. Also there are many policy discussions that take place on this site, I often find that editors who disagree with me on one issue agree with me on another.

The answer is simply written from the perspective of an editor, not an admin; it does not display the required understanding of 3RR or exemptions to it. I'm not saying that the hypothetical example necessarily required blocking but the answer required discussion of these issues, and a mention of [[WP:BITE]] and helping the errant IP (eg with a welcome message or friendly note) would have been nice. In addition, taking an interest in the content issue is fine (sometimes illuminates how to interpret the behaviour), but your comment about not starting up the edit war again also seems underthought: if the sole objection given was the lack of sourcing, re-adding with a (reliable) source should resolve the issue better than leaving it on the talk page, especially given the IP's previous failure to use the talk page."

Tim seems to have a lot of experience in dealing with project issues, and to have been calm and fair in doing that work ... but wikipedia will be dead if editors are not at its core, and from what I have seen Tim has hardly any experience at the coalface.

However, I don't personally see much evidence of positive interaction and discussion rather than just automatic templating, particularly with anons.  When considering automated edits, we often fail to make the right distinction here, I feel, counting Twinkle and Huggle similarly. The difference is that one can use Twinkle purely as an editing aid to open pages for you, and grab templates as and if you need them, whilst still maintaining a level of personal interaction. Huggle doesn't even require you to look at the user talk page or history (you can, but you don't have to) - and so it can encourage a robotic impersonal approach, and makes it easy to make mistakes quickly. I'd encourage more manual interaction with users you revert. I can certainly see this candidate being a good admin in future, and I think this slight shift in focus could help a lot. &nbsp;"

I would probably trust you with the ""cleaning"" part (eg. deleting articles that say ""I like pie!!!!!! lulz"") and perhaps a bit of ""security work (eg. blocking blatant and persistent vandalism-only accounts), but there is more to the role than that. I presume you wouldn't expect your janitor to put students in [[School punishment#Detention|detention]] or suspend them, or to decide when they can come back to school, or to fire teachers or to go through students' work and get rid of some of it. To move away from the analogy, adminship is a bit more complicated (blocking and protecting during content disputes for example). Content work is important not just for the sake of it, not just to show that you care about the project, but because it helps to show that you understand policies & guidelines and that you can work effectively with editors you disagree with. That can be demonstrated in other ways, but I'm not seeing any overwhelming evidence here. It also helps you to understand better the context within which content disputes arise.

A7 isn't even about ''notability'', as Wikipedia defines it, it is about whether or not the article plausibly claims importance. An article that says ""Sam is my neighbor and is really smart"" doesn't assert importance, ""Sam is my neighbor and is an alien from Jupiter"" is implausible, ""Sam is my neighbor and is a famous local radio personality"" plausibly asserts importance. Even if the article explains that the radio station is a pirate station with few listeners, you'd have to bring the article to [[WP:PROD]] or [[WP:AFD]] to delete it. That's our process.

You seem like a very conscientious editor, dedicated to improving the project. But looking at your contribs for the last 3-4 months, I get a somewhat strange impression. You say in answering Q1 that one of your intended areas of admin work is CSD. Yet, looking back to March, I saw maybe one or two CSD taggings that you did yourself (well, to be more accurate: I am not an admin so I can't see your deleted contributions record. But I only saw one or two author notifications about CSD tags that you did during that time).  Speedy deletion is a high precision area where pretty solid understanding of CSD criteria is needed by the admin reviewing a CSD tag, and I would really like to see some significant positive evidence that you understand them well. Regarding images and files. That is definitely an area where additional admins are very much needed. However, again looking at your contrib record for the last three months, I don't see a whole lot of activity on your part in files for deletion discussions, PUF discussions etc (most of what I have seen are ""delete, per nom"" brief !votes). In particular, I would have really like to see more instances where you yourself listed files for deletion or at PUF of CSD tagged them. I found very few such examples, the latest occurring in very early May. In fact, one of these examples worries me a bit. First you tagged an image as speedy with a pretty strange justification[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Wtc2.jpg&diff=prev&oldid=359391576], which clearly did not correspond to any of the CSD criteria. Of course, the speedy was declined. You then listed the same file for deletion. That particular discussion was [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Files_for_deletion/2010_May_2#File:Wtc2.jpg closed as ""keep""]. I looked at the image, File:Wtc2.jpg, rather closely, and I still don't understand why you thought that the image was obtained by joining two images, ""of which its copyright status is unknown"". You certainly did not provide any justification for that in the discussion. I normally would not concentrate on an episode from that far back, but that was, it would appear, your second to last files for deletion nomination to date (the last one occurred on the same day, May 2).

The answers are brief to the point of being curt, and in some cases (eg Q4) don't even answer the question. An admin needs to be able to express themselves well in discussion and properly explain what they're doing and why (and in some ways, I think that's a more important attribute than knowing what buttons to press). However, I appreciate that this RfA is still young, that a lot of questions have been asked, and that the candidate might simply have been a bit overwhelmed by them and hasn't really had time to answer them properly.

Paul Erik,Herostratus,-1,-1,2010,"02:37, 30 June 2010","'''Oppose''' – I found this a difficult decision, but I'm just not confident in his judgment. A crucial quality in an admin (in my view) is the ability to ''reduce'' the drama-level of discussions. With Herostratus, drama seems to ''increase'', as he wades into areas without quite knowing how his comments and actions will be seen by others. (I would say that even this very non-RfA RfA is an example.) His possibly-BLP-violating comments in the AfD are not something new for him: see also his completely unnecessary comments ""[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/User:SupaFly98/Megan_E._Wagner&diff=prev&oldid=350440412 the girl is just not that pretty]"" and ""[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/User:Judge_Trudy&diff=prev&oldid=350442130 talentless mope]"" at MfDs. One can debate whether or not these project-space insults violate BLP policy, but either way this is not the sort of decorum one expects from admins. It doesn't help that he [[Wikipedia:Material concerning living persons in non-article space|misunderstood]] BLP policy as being primarily about Wikimedia avoiding lawsuits. His close of deletion discussions suggest a lack of understanding of process as well, for example [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2010_May_6&diff=prev&oldid=364334742 this close as ""merge denied""] is a lengthy and cogent explanation but in no way is it an attempt at determining the consensus of the discussion's ''participants'' (he seems to be using his status as admin as a ""super-vote"" though I don't doubt he was doing it in good faith, and yes I know it was upheld at DRV). So, contrary to some of the supporters here, I do see a ''pattern'' of problems with Herostratus, and think he should relinquish adminship until it is clear that he has the trust of the community again. He certainly can do plenty of good work (and has done plenty of good work) here without the tools. <font face=""Comic sans MS"">"

Wifione,TheCatalyst31,1,1,2010,"13:16, 30 October 2010","'''Extremely Strong Support''' I believe the editor is an extremely competent prospective administrator. I checked his speedies, prods and AfDs. Cumulatively, when I minutely checked, 98 of the past 100 deletion nominations have been deleted - that's very good and impressive for me; and I think a similar number is what he has for the next 100 or so of his deletion nominations. I checked his new articles created count. The editor has 2456 new articles created in his 19872 edits - the figure (of ''2456 new articles'') is an outstanding evidence of the quintessential sincerity the editor holds towards contributing for our project! Talking about content, with 13 DYKs, 3 Good Articles, and one Featured List, the editor has proven that he can qualify quite competently on proving his mettle on the quality scale and on the clue-scale. Can he improve further in his content contributions? Of course, yes; and much! Even a cursory look around our project will show that the Catalyst can use many brilliant editors as his benchmarks; editors who have gone ahead and created multiple FAs, and who continue doing so even post becoming administrators. The Catalyst has many stubs to his creation credit that he can, is improving, and should do so further. Still, does his policy knowledge qualify as outstanding? Clearly not. And clearly again, it should have qualified so; more importantly because he might have ended up mis-applying the very policies he's supposed to utilise if he were to become an admin. Is this admin-hopeful so clueless that he cannot fathom the (mis)understanding of a situation/rule despite being told so? My perception is that, that is not the case. The fact is that this editor has shown regard and respect for being open to change and improvement throughout this RfA and even through his past two plus years with our project. I do observe his dissonance in trite badgering; yet, the editor has given his worth of sincere commitment through the past two years towards our project with a grinding schedule of working with an extremely civil orientation. And post all that, he has requested for adminship. I know that we have administrators who I look up to (like Fetchcomms, Fastily, John, Nikkimaria) in the oppose/neutral section; and I see some of my peers too, in Bejinhan, Salvio. Given all this, I take this opportunity to implore my peers, my administrators and the other respected editors in the oppose/neutral section to re-look at their vote considering one question which has become clichéd at our RfAs, yet retains its pertinence within its simplistic naivety, ""Will this candidate be a net positive to our project?"" If you truly believe the answer to this to be no, I will respect your vote - as most of you have more experience than have I. Yet, a moment of requestion will not take away the potency of your vote. With sincere regards."

This [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/The_Thing_That_Should_Not_Be_2&diff=391755265&oldid=391754968 one diff] is probably the most concerning, though I will regard it as a one off incident in a tough RfA. While I stated earlier that if I was in TTTSNB's shoes I would have diversified my editing a bit more before coming back to RfA, that's because there is a large enough minority at RfA to bring a request down due on content creation issues, not because I think it is necessary. In fact, I believe TTTSNB has learnt and done enough as it is to be an admin, and unless I think they were justified, addressing the concerns raised in a previous RfA are not a requirement for me to support a subsequent one. While I expect admins to stick to policies and guidelines, and respect community consensus in general, TTTSNB's previous RfAs (with the possible exception of the first one) failed as consensus was not reached, even if more people supported than opposed, and the views of the opposition in these RfAs did not equate to a community consensus."

Joke or not, I could wish for better judgement and urge you to consider your future words with greater care when you are handed the tools today.  Admins really need to lead by example, as I see it, and civility is important to many of us here when it comes to working together.

Second, while the candidate believes blocks are preventative rather than punitive, there is no clear indication here exactly what harm is being prevented and indeed significant suggestion of punishment for being a bad admin. Third, and most seriously for me, the candidate then proposes to suggest to the blocked admin that they ""''use some of that time looking for the kind of acceptable sources that the other editor is apparently having trouble locating''""!

Acalamari,Everyking,1,1,2010,"03:24, 24 January 2010","As one of Everyking’s former nominators, I’m here to give him my continued support. First off, I want to address the AfD issue and tool usage: Everyking has spent years to restore his reputation and standing, building and creating hundreds of articles, making over 125,000 edits, working with people, putting countless hours of work into the project, and been through several rough RfAs. Why would he, if resysopped, go on a mass AfD closing spree or do any other sort of abuse with the tools? Why would he want to do that? No one who has been through what Everyking has been through would want to do something foolish like that: if Everyking really wanted to damage Wikipedia, he could quite easily have created a sock, got it up to adminship, and pushed his views with that sock, as that would have been far more easy to achieve. Instead, he’s stuck with the one account, been open and honest with his views, and at same time sticks to his principle of not subverting the project’s rules in favor of his own views. Besides, if he did start closing AfDs in light of saying many times that he wouldn’t, or started abusing his tools, Everyking would not be an admin very long after that, as many users who placed their trust in him would call for his resignation, and if he didn’t follow through with that, his desysopping. In addition, closing AfDs is not all adminship entails: I myself don’t close XfDs, and am not hindered in any way by it, so Everyking won’t be a “partial admin” at all (in fact, I suspect that Everyking's tool usage will be similar to mine: using the tools in assist in everyday editing, such as coming across vandals to block, and there aren't any complaints). Based on all of this, I don’t believe he would ever begin closing or have any reason to close AfDs, nor would he have any reason to abuse the tools in any way either. Regarding Wikipedia Review, it’s disappointing that there still seems to be a dislike of WR among a few users, despite the fact that countless editors (regular editors, admins, and arbitrators) all participate there. Overall, I believe Everyking has improved over the years (I'm very impressed with his answers to the questions), learned from his mistakes, and will be a better admin than he ever was before (bearing in mind that he never abused the tools nor his position when he was an admin). I strongly support his candidacy."

At its core, participating in Wikipedia is about writing articles. Much of what we see over at [[WP:ANI]] ultimately deals with conflicts in the article-writing process (and, it must be noted, much of what eventually makes its way to ArbCom), and as such I believe it important that admins have a firm firsthand knowledge of that process. In the same way as being a complete article-writer and having no experience in admin-like tasks is a quick way to fail an RfA, I'm also of the belief that pure wikignoming/low-level content creation is not suited to the role of adminship. I regret having to oppose this RfA, but I simply don't see enough experience at the higher levels of article work that are so critical to wikipedia as a whole.

While requesting advice is fine, your tone in those posts came across as a bit loaded. Your responses to the questions are shallow, and don't seem to give the voter much to go by. You mention [[First Crusade]] as one of your proudest article contributions, but to be perfectly honest, it seems that your work there was still mainly minor and cosmetic in nature. This isn't bad by any means, but I'd like to see some more evidence of appreciable article work to outweigh the other problems I see. Finally, I'm really not comfortable with your answer to #3. Editing Wikipedia alongside family members isn't forbidden, but given the circumstances, it seems like a bad idea to me.

It is pretty clear that for the moment the candidate does not have enough experience to be an admin and the answers to the first three questions are rather telling in this regard. The candidate lists closing AfDs as one of the main areas of prospective admin work; yet, looking through the candidate's controb record to date, there is very little (almost none) participation in AfDs there. In fact, the candidate has only 252 edits to Wikipedia+Wikipedia talk namespaces altogether. The answer to Q2 also sounds pretty naive and fairly strange. Looking at the candidate's last 500 edits (since early March 2010), I see almost no vandalism reverts there and no reports to AIV. So how exactly does vandalism reversion qualify as the candidate's best contribution? I am also troubled by the fact that Hadger accepted the RfA nomination from a user who has been editing Wikipedia (at least from their current account) for less than 10 days and in relation to whom suspicions of sockpuppetry have been raised, see [[User talk:Rohedin#Prior usernames]]. Accepting such a nomination does not demonstrate the best judgement by the candidate."

A look at this user's edits show them to be courteous, highly active (recently) and experienced in areas which desperately need admin attention. The main question seems to be over his/her long break from editing. Now, if this was immediately following (or within a couple of months) of a user's return, I would most probably oppose on those grounds. Policies and guidelines shift massively over time, and an administrator has tools that require knowledge of a fair few of them, particularly in relation to the ""delete"" button - notability guidelines, particularly those relating to BLPs, are the guidelines most constantly and regularly in flux. Four or five months of activity is easily enough to get a grip on most of them, and none of this user's highly intelligent and verbose answers to the questions indicate, to me, that he/her does not have such a grip. The issue is over experience. While 28bytes may be experienced in DYK and other areas, the tools (as mentioned) cover a wide swathe of ground. I would expect to see much of this ground well-trodden by the user in question before I could support. Please don't take this as a bad thing; get some more experience, reapply in six months, and I can see nothing which would prevent me from giving a strong support."

I found that Elockid showed evidence of some of these qualities in dealings with other users - I liked what I saw at [[IQ and the Wealth of Nations]], and at [[Filipino people]] - the user appears quite level headed, dealing calmly and sensibly with other users, usually checking facts and data carefully.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw the name in the RfA TOC, but Wehwalt's signature is reassuring. With that said, as someone who has (maybe?) helped him get his bearings, it seems like just yesterday WS spent much of his time engaging in highly unnecessary disputes with respected users or unnecessary chatter on his talk page. He has made one of the most spectacular turnarounds I've ever seen in my three years on Wikipedia, but yet I feel he needs several more months to detach himself from his checkered past. I have no reason to believe he would deliberately misuse the admin bit, nor do I believe he would accidentally induce mayhem, but I don't yet think of WS as ""admin material"", however vague that may be. My advice would be to continue to establish yourself as a solid article creator. I'm well aware that one can literally change his ways in an instant, but in a community like ours, where every last mistake and quarrel is forever etched into multiple historical records, a consistent track record is necessary to pass RfA.

Because most of the articles on my watch list are articles that have been marred by POV-pushers (as stated in the findings of a recent [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Race_and_intelligence | Arbitration Committee case]], I'm acutely aware of the importance of [[WP:V | Wikipedia verifiability policy]] for the integrity of Wikipedia. Sources shouldn't just be kind-of, sort-of reliable sources, but plainly reliable sources. The candidate's forthrightness in admitting disputes with other users is commendable, but of course this kind of dispute while not holding the mop doesn't bode well for wielding the mop dispassionately. As a non-administrator, I figure one of the most important qualities in an administrator is keeping cool when trouble-makers start pressing buttons. (I have had moderator or sysop powers on various other online forums since 1993.) The candidate has some good qualities, but is somewhat reluctant about accepting the nomination, and my advice would be to wait, become well established in the scholarly community of college, and try RfA again after more maturity and seasoning.

It's not unusual at all to have a fraction of our CSD taggings declined, nor is it unusual for our PROD tags to be contested. While Ironholds did tag some articles in the new-page backlog incorrectly, and while some of his AfD nominations weren't the strongest, I think it's helpful to look at them in context. Ironholds patrolled so many pages at the end of 2009 that the incorrect taggings are actually a small fraction. Like J.delanoy above, I trust Ironholds to approach the delete button cautiously as an administrator, and I do trust him to do the right thing. Therefore, I share the concerns that SoWhy, F&W, and DGG voice, but I don't think they are enough to prevent me from supporting. Ironholds' involvement in the Law incident does not bother me; let's not forget that it was The undertow who was truly in the wrong, engaging in ban evasion. I also firmly reject the notion that eliminating the unpatrolled backlog at [[Special:NewPages]] is a bad thing. Finally, Ironholds is a terrific content contributor, with 4 FAs, 13 FLs, 13 GAs, and 122 DYK credits, which is always a big enough plus in my book that I am moved to support this RfA.

But not at all because they listed a PhD, and only slightly because of question 5. Question 5 betrays to me a superficial familiarity with vandalism patrolling (I see no AIV edits) but good intentions. Vandalism patrolling is easier because of anon edits, and without it we'd have less silly vandalism and more persistent, harder to track vandalism. Of the few AfD opinions that are there, the most recent seems to be broadly out of consensus ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Objectivism and primitivism]]), and I don't see a large history of policy edits or discussions. I don't require that in an admin. The only suggestions of admin activities in Question 1 are anti-vandal activities, of which I see almost no experience of this admin. Moreover, the 7 article creations (other editors have been rejected having more content creations) have a focus, and combined with the concerns above, I don't see a need for the tools, and I see some real concern over other issues, although they may be minor on their own."

You say you want to delete articles under the CSD criteria, but do you have any experience tagging such articles? Looking at your contributions, I can only see one warning to a user about a CSD tag, back in July (your 7th live contribution!). Was that your only CSD tag or have you not been warning editors about them? Finally, just a small point, but your over-complicate talkpage instructions and system may be a bit off-putting to new users (is [[User talk:Joe Gazz84/private|this]] really necessary?) Keep up the good work here, but I would definitely leave it at least several months before another RFA.--"

Jennavecia,Sam Blacketer,1,-1,2010,"23:30, 3 January 2010","'''Moral support'''. While I'm loathe to vote near Aitias' troll support, I believe Sam did well as an administrator. I appreciate the way he's handling himself in this RFA, which is not going well for him at all. I also appreciate his restraint and well-considered responses to others. I don't presume all editors keep track of who've they've been blocked by in years past, nor do I believe everyone remembers every editor they've been in some sort of conflict or disagreement with. I've come to believe that users have a right to a fresh start. Regardless, he's applying for adminship, not ArbCom, and his history of use of administrative tools is good. I do find it concerning that full disclosure was not made with the start of this RFA. The numbered list gives some basic information, but there are no links or previous account names to follow. For those who were previously unaware of the situations being mentioned, it doesn't give a sufficient detailing of the significance of what happened. Further, I'm not seeing a clear promise not to repeat mistakes, but I do see where it's noted it would be risky for someone identified to act inappropriately, and I think I can take it as given that he doesn't intend to be deceitful again. I further appreciate his candid answers to my questions. The one serious admin actions that seems to have come into question was four years ago. I can't bring myself to care about something that happened so long ago. And while I found the overlap between the two accounts a bit troubling, without evidence that there was abusive sockpuppetry, rather than a desire to keep suspicion away as Sam has expressed, then I'm no longer concerned with it. When it comes down to it, do I trust him with the admin tools? That's the important question to ask in RFAs. While I do understand the concerns of many of those in the oppose section, for me, all considered (his past admin history, the drama he's dealt with in the fallout of his actions, and the fact that he'd have people watching him like hawks), I do trust him with this particular set of tools. <big>"

I am a former admin who resigned the bit voluntarily after some minor conflict, by the way.<br>On the ArbCom sanction, I feel that all's well that ends well. The candidate's actions in unblocking himself simply corrected a technical error and when viewed at the time rather than in hindsight, could be justified as an application of [[WP:IAR]]. ArbCom's reaction was more for the sake of demonstrating a point than a real attempt at repudiation. The candidate does not deserve desysopping for this (and ArbCom had jurisdiction to do that, and did not desysop him). On the joke on his website, the candidate acted in a way that was silly but does not deserve desysopping. Calling a man a 'mook' is undignified but does not deserve desysopping. <br>The candidate asserted that a particular man, a politician from California, called himself a bigot and homophobe. If the candidate could find a source that demonstrates that the candidate described himself in those words, then the candidate's use of those words in relation to the man would be entirely justifiable. But he has no such source. I have examined the subject's website and it does not proclaim him as a bigot or homophobe. Google returns no statements of the type. <br>The candidate relies on the contents of the subject's website, and states that it contains ""code words"" that are equivalent to the subject calling himself a bigot and homophobe. The candidate's drawing too long a bow. To describe the man as a bigot and homophobe, and to say that he himself described himself in those terms, is going too far. <br>It is well documented that US law defends freedom of speech, especially in relation to politicians. The candidate's words are almost certainly not legally actionable. I agree that [[WP:BLP]] exists for reasons other than avoiding lawsuits. But the comments were not made in a biography and so I find that BLP does not apply. <br>It is wrong, and against the interests of this project, to make incorrect and unfair statements of this type in an AfD discussion.

I was thinking about Supporting him this time, but just can't bring myself to do it (maybe it's because I have yet to support a self-nom, heh).  I remember in one of his prior RFAs, I was going to vote Oppose because of some dispute I was having with him at the time - can't remember exactly what that was.  Anyway, we talked about whatever it was and I told him that if he ran again I wouldn't Oppose.  I could be misremembering this entirely, so let me stop rambling.  I do believe Thumperward means well, and I do see him fairly often making helpful edits on articles I watch.  My own past experiences have shown that he can be pretty brusque when dealing with other people, and I can see quite a few people in the Oppose section and even a few Supports have had similar or worse experiences.  I think the ability to show restraint when dealing with others is an important one in an admin - even if it means you'll need the help of other admins to get you through a situation.  The reason I brought up Kww earlier is because while his third RFA was awfully contentious for some similar reasons and the crats had no confidence to promote, his 4th RFA six months later passed with landslide support.

I take him at his word when he says that he would defer to other admins in areas beyond his ken until he develops more understanding in those areas. Also, he would not be the only admin who works primarily in vandal fighting (e.g., Tide rolls, a vandal fighter whose elevation to admin was a step in the right directon).

Besides enthusiastically agreeing with the nominators' comments above, the one extra thing I'd like to mention is !James's thoroughness. There are a number of reasons people prefer admin candidates to have article-writing experience, of which perhaps the most common (and to my mind convincing) is that it makes them less likely to wade in with the tools with no appreciation for the ""editors' eye view"" of the situation. !James's article output is smaller than some - though by no means negligible - but I think any potential lack there is more than made up for by his thoughtfulness and thoroughness. A look through his talk page archives and some of the diffs above shows many conversations where he's gone beyond the call to patiently research a situation before explaining things to confused or abusive editors where many others would have simply dumped a few [[Wikipedia:WTF? OMG! TMD TLA. ARG!|TLA]]s and moved on.

I come to this view largely because of my one ""run-in"" with the candidate, which was at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Canbourne University (2nd nomination)]], an AfD started by Floquenbeam that I personally found annoying. At the time, I feared that Floqenbeam was going to turn out to be a smug holier-than-thou deletionist who has little empathy for the challenges faced by contributors who build and maintain articles. I am pleased to discover that I was wrong -- it seems this is one of just a couple of AfDs he ever initiated and one of only a very few that he ever participated in. Furthermore, he says he's not interested in doing XfDs. I think, however, that it is beneficial for administrators to have some experience in content creation -- in order to have some empathy for the concerns of contributors who research topics and write prose, and it appears to me that Floquenbeam lacks that kind of experience. The experience that his nominator describes as ""content creation"" is more along the lines of ""article cleanup."" I expect that this RfA will be succcessful, and I am voting ""neutral"" because I want the candidate to think seriously about the need for him to try doing some actual content creation in order to get that experience. --"

SoWhy,PresN,-1,1,2010,"15:44, 14 November 2010","'''Weak oppose''' I think this candidate has the best interests of the project at heart but I don't think adminship is right for him. I share many of the concerns mentioned above about the lack of edit summaries. While his reply to question #8 might be plausible, it also demonstrates a lack of understanding what edit summaries are for. They are not only to explain potentially confusing edits but should allow people to understand what you did without having to review your edits. Also, it's not easy (if possible at all) for anyone to judge whether an edit of theirs is potentially ""non obvious"". As jc37 put it, communication is a vital skill for an admin and edit summaries are one of the main tools for said communication to happen. I can understand missing a summary here and there (my record isn't 100% either, although those edits are from 2004 or 2005) but the candidate is systematically not using them, as he admits himself, which is not something an admin should do. We have plenty of such admins already and each one of them makes Wikipedia a bit harder for old and new users to use. On a side note, as some mentioned above, CSD is more tricky than it looks, so if this is successful, please consult a more experienced admin in that area before starting to work there (despite my opposing !vote, I would of course be happy to help). I don't think that's a reason for opposing the request though, many admins found their area only after they were granted the tools. Regards '''"

Shadowjams,Jamesofur,-1,1,2010,"01:29, 16 April 2010","'''Oppose''' - Absolutely not enough experience here. I could easily support if there was some more content editing (and this is ''not'' something I generally oppose on). There are only '''1,382 non automated edits''' and only 9 months with over 3 edits (5 with more than 100). Some of those are manually warnings. I don't know the number of mainspace edits that weren't automated or rollbacks, but it's obviously lower than that 1,382 number. This is just after we came off of another candidate who had a tremendous number of edits both automated and not, but was opposed for the percentage of automated edits. To be clear: I have no problem with automated edits (I have a lot of them), but I think it's appropriate to discount them somewhat (maybe 50%?). Even if we didn't discount them in this case at all, combine that with S Marshall's very valid concern that there's 0 page creation, I'm stunned at the arbitrary fashion that the ""automated edits"" or ""not enough experience"" claims get thrown at editors. I think this could be a successful admin run ''with more experience'' but there's just not enough activity to support. I'd be fine supporting a strong content editor with 3,000 edits, but not a vandal patroller with that few who's only been truly active for 9 months (and that's being generous about what's ""active"" for admin purposes.) Even including edits to simple wiki, by my count there are about 2,001 edits at Simple Wiki (no edit counter; looking at 500 x 4 + 1 edit pages), many of them with TW too."

""go away and don't come back until you've touched an article with more than AWB"". This is no longer about content edits; it wasn't, for me, when the second RfA came around. This is about a user who, when faced with community consensus about his behaviour and actions in relation to community trust, chooses ignoring it and biding his time as a preferable option to listening. Any RfA is based, as X! says, around the question ""do you trust this user as an admin?"", and the answer has to be ""no"". Why? Because an admin has to listen to the community. Because an admin has to be able to accept when he's wrong, or when his opinions on a block, or delete, or article protection, are different from those of everyone else in the room. I have yet to see a shred of evidence that The Thing is capable of that; on the contrary, as I have shown, the only evidence is that he ignores community consensus. I do not want an admin who does that. I particularly do not want an admin who does that on issues of trust."
True Pagan Warrior,Kww,0,1,2010,"11:28, 18 April 2010","I opposed the last time around due to serious concern's about the candidate's attitude when interacting with other people.  His behavior during that RfA was above reproach and showed that he's ''capable'' of much, much better, but my cynical side expects that when the stress levels rise that ugliness will be front and center.  Considering his experience and skill, the significant shift in community attitude towards him, and the fact that my own view is based in part on cynicism, I do not feel my concerns are sufficient to oppose.  I wish the candidate luck.--'''~"
Kudpung,Gobbleswoggler,-1,-1,2010,"11:49, 16 February 2010","'''Oppose''' - HI, with  regard to  the edit summaries, it  would probably  be best  if you were to  get  used to  always making them ''before'' you  become an admin. The same goes for one or two  other tasks, such as regularly  looking  at  your talk page and taking  part in  discussions. Nobobody  has been rude to  you - there have been plenty  of friendly  requests on  your talk  page to  conform  to the way  some things are done on  Wikipedia, but  if you  choose to  ignore them, then the tone of the requests will  become stricter, but  not  ruder. The admin  tools will  require you  not  only  to  fight  vandalism, but  also  to  do many  other operations that  require an acute sense of good judgement. I don't  think  you  have this yet, and you  probably  need to  get  a lot more experience before becoming  an admin,  so  I  would suggest  that  we all  agree to  close this second request as per [[ WP:SNOW]] and [[WP:NOTNOW]], and give you  a chance to  apply again  in  several  months time.--"

I'm not saying I don't believe Red but it's his edits that we should judge.  Second, I'm concerned about the way Redthoreau invokes the names of absent editors; on the [[Wikipedia:Featured article review/Che Guevara/archive1|Che Guevara FAR]], Jbmurray, Mattisse, Ling.Nut and myself were all in agreement that there were problems that Redthoreau argued didn't exist.

Communication is key in this venue, and from what I can see, Alansohn's is less than fruitful. Sure, the blocks are troubling. Even more so, is the behavior and actions that led to the various blocks, shades of which continue, as evidenced in recent AfD and DRV conversations. I also see poor choices in overt, as well as passive aggressive behavior in responses to this RfA, expressing appreciation to another editor for a noose with which to hang himself, relating to IP users believed to be vandals as ""infantile"", and attempting to deflect attention from his own shortcomings by pointing out the edits of others, which he deems substandard. Sure, there's a lot of back and forth in this RfA, which equates to ""I know you are, but what am I?"" attacks, but the snide remarks of one editor does not justify the snide remarks of another. As evidenced in this discussion, it is apparent that Alansohn continues to lack the ability to maintain decorum through disputes.

Passing over the nomination for another admin to deal with is perfectly acceptable, but not declining it. Speedy deletions are discretionary, but that doesn't mean the discretion can properly be denied its exercise by an admin just because the admin is unsure of its application. I'm also unsure of the answer to 4.b - has the question been answered the wrong way around or am I confused?

I made these two edits to the ""see also"" section, which I think were rather innocuous: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crucifixion&diff=prev&oldid=332695972] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crucifixion&diff=next&oldid=332695972].

Some of the more striking  poor creations are: [[Peter Taylor (composer)]];  the very short [[List of Big Band Musicians]] that  hasn't had an edit  since it was created 10 months ago, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_big_band_musicians&action=history], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_artery], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_McCracken, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalsneak], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_upper_quadrant_(abdomen)], I'm  not  sure of the usefulness of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agro-] (maybe there's a guideline  I  have missed),  and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_iliac_fossa], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcuate_line_of_rectus_sheath], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_umbilical_ligament], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast_to_coast_goal], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_atmosphere], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_bodybuilding], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_manager].

""  The candidate has confused recent action on clearing up  old unworked-on unsourced BLPs with a change in BLPs in general, and standard he wants--  ''clearly'' established -- is   drastically more restrictive than any that has been serious proposed by anyone else.  That he would consult with an other admin is no better, for the result would then depend on whom he consults with. Everyone involved on both sides is the recent débacle was an admin, and we don't need another admin like that.  The Rosatti was an instance where upon not getting the content he wanted in, he moved to delete the article; a better approach would have been to keep what there was left while looking for better sources--this is now harder to do than it otherwise would have been.  Deleting content and then the article is a tactic which is almost always destructive to the encyclopedia.   Given that his main interest is in closing AfD discussions this is utterly unacceptable. He is free to advocate changing policy, but he has to understand and accept   the present one. I have supported people with other view on what policy should be like than my own, but not if they are so clearly willing to act on what they merely hope will be policy. to be fair, however, perhaps his views are based on inexperience, and will be overcome by more --and more  varied-- activities in the months to come,and a future nomination might be reasonable.

There is great work on anti-vandalism: reversions, AIV reports, RPP, etc. The new page patrolling is also good. But what I don't see is experience and skills working with other editors in difficult situations, in consensus-building, or with relevant ''content'' policies. I don't think article-writing should be a pre-requisite for adminship, but those other fields I just mentioned should. Because adminship is more than nailing IP vandals at AIV and hitting speedy deletions; even with those two mechanical tasks more judgment and communication skills are required of an admin than of a non-admin editor. It would not take much to change my mind - either evidence of good experience the matters I've mentioned that I've missed here, or future experience that would get my support in a future RfA.--"

You cannot AGF regarding unsubstantiated accusations. The statement needs sourcing or removing - that is the priority. The drama can be eased with a few soft words and a gentle but firm explanation of policy. And if it is felt that RunOff had got a little over-heated with some comments, then that can happen at times, and a quiet conversation - perhaps off-wiki - along the lines of: ""I note that you got a bit stressed there - if you need help in future, give me a call"" would be helpful. <span style=""border: 1px  #F10; background-color:cream;"">'''"

Work in those area's often signals a need for the tools, as well as an understanding of the policies related to them.

I see a well meaning candidate, though I don't see much that gives me confidence - especially in terms of the candidate's knowledge and judgement. The blocks are a while ago, so are not a major issue, though they are a factor to be considered, especially when there's not much to offer in compensation. I see little to actively admire in the candidate's contributions - there's some friendly chit chat here and there, but no significant drive to build Wikipedia, and no evidence of sound knowledge of our policies. Indeed, I am concerned about the low overall activity over the past year and a half, and the comments [[User:Wilhelmina_Will/RfA_review|here]], while they are quite old, are still linked to from the candidate's userpage and a statement that admins should be ""domineering over lesser users"" makes me feel uncomfortable; no matter that it's from 2008, it's a mind set that I don't appreciate someone having. <span style=""border: 1px  #F10; background-color:cream;"">'''"

The Fys account had been desysopped for abuse of admin powers, which is absolutely something that the candidate should have disclosed.  The worst offense was failing to recuse from voting on ArbCom sanctions against editors by whom the Fys account had been blocked or with whom “Fys” had otherwise interacted negatively.  His actions regarding JzG and Viridae at [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/C68-FM-SV]] and regarding William M. Connolley at [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Geogre-William M.

Richard observed the edit warring but made very few attempts to resolve the situation, other than a couple of requests that people stop edit warring. Richard rightly commented that the article needed to be reduced drastically in size, but didn't do anything about it. I made some bold edits, removing extensive material on specific subjects to the respective subject pages, which finally defused the edit warring on the page, a move which Richard supported. I would have liked to have seen Richard take active steps to resolving the problem, especially since the entire issue was the result of one consistently disruptive editor, [[User:Esoglou]].--"

While not treating nonvandals like vandals is arguably more important, I think being able to confidently and correctly distinguish vandalism from other problematic kinds of edits is also very important - especially for an admin who intends to focus on dealing with edit warring and vandalism. Wrt q4, from your comments to Mkativerata on your user page, you seem to think that KMalaysia has crossed the 3rr line, but KMalaysia has not. I don't know if this was a counting mistake or a misunderstanding of the rule, and in any case your plan to use {{tl|uw-3rr}} and not block is correct, but ""for the wrong reasons"" as they say. Also I don't read [[WP:ADMIN#Administrator conduct]] as saying they are ""more blockable"". I don't necessarily think the block was completely wrong, but I think admins should be blocked exactly when others are blocked; to have a different standard means that you are essentially using the blocks as a punitive measure rather than a preventative one, I think."

I did not know anything about the controversy leading to the May resignation, but now, after reading through the relevant pages, I don't believe that trusting the candidate with admin tools is warranted. The  Dbiv/Fys account has an extensive block log and history of disruption. Fys was desysopped by arbcom for serious abuse of admin tools. The Fys account and the Sam Blacketer account have an overlap of almost a year: Sam Blacketer started editing on December 13, 2006 while Fys continued editing until Nov 10, 2007. So this was not the case of an editor vanishing and then making a clean start. Yet Sam did not disclose his Fys history during his original April 2007 RfA (at the time when Fys was still editing), or during the ArbCom elections later (in fact, the nominating process for [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2007]] started on Nov 1, 2007, while Fys was still editing). I don't see any apologies for this abuse of trust in Sam's nominating statement above. As an arb, Sam accepted and voted in the W.M. Connolley RFAR, even though Fys filed an RFC against WMC in 2006. Although Fys had been blocked by Tango in 2006, Sam made extensive comments in Tango's RFAR in 2008. Given these kinds of serious breaches of trust in the past, I don't think that seven months of good behaviour since the May resignation is nearly long enough for the candidate to ask for the tools back.  Even for a brand new user starting from scratch with a clean slate I would want to see at least 9-10 months of editing before asking for the sysop button; for somebody with as extensive history of problems and abuse of trust as we have in this case, that period should certainly be much longer."

The problem is this Ling.Nut.Dark business, and the ""solemn assertion that I will retire all over-colorful language"". I'm very much inclined to trust that solemn assertion, but the problem I have is that if I am mistaken, then, in the absence of a sensible desysop process, there is no comeback - giving admin rights is a one-way street. And so I feel I just can't support someone based on what they promise they will do, no matter how much I feel it is a trustworthy promise - I can only base my decision on what people can show they have already done.

It takes a big man to accept good advice and change his actions based on it. Who cares if he appears to really really want to be an admin? Good for him. In your job (if you're a manager) and an employee really really wants a promotion and does the things that make this possible, do you go ""Nah, wants it too much""? We're supposed to be working to take our skills and responsibilities up the the next level. As to content creation, good grief. First of all, he ''is'' a perfectly adequate content creator, and second of all, administrating is not about creating content. ""Only"" seven articles created, give me a break.

I don't see anyone here asking for a string of FAs or GAs, but given your past feedback, it would be nice to see you put some effort (and concentration) into demonstrating that you think content matters. Comments from you here and elsewhere seem to suggest the opposite.  As an administrator you will have the ability to delete pages, protect/unprotect pages and block editors involved in content disputes, so it's important that you have some experience here. I find it hard to believe that there is no article on anything you are interested that needs work. Again, not necessarily looking for FA standard, but how about adding references to a completely unreferenced article?<br />Secondly, I'm not sure I trust you with the extra buttons, because I think you may be a little trigger-happy. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&diff=prev&oldid=377695762 Edits like this] are alarming, or would be if you had the block button.

Given the fact that you don't really ''need'' the tools (not normally a reason to oppose, let's face it, most of us don't ''need'' the tools), the fact that this is your 4th (?)

''''First''', I'm worried about recent-edits, really only since August of 2009, about 8 months of admin-level editing. '''Second''' is the relatively low edit count when you consider the automated edits. When you design your own tools they don't always show up in the toolserver automated edit system. It's pretty easy to do that, and the 2,400 odd article edits are probably the more accurate article count, although determining that exactly is hard. '''Third''', the lack of hard choices in AfD, among other places, the lack of broader opinion seeking (echoing Durova here) and a few comments at [[WT:NEWT]] that bother me, are all especially acute here. I would like to see some more opinions, which will undoubtedly lose some !votes either way, but would at least give us a better idea broadly. But the programing skills and general decorum keep me from opposing."

As such, I will AGF that further improvement will not cease if they are made an admin and thus it will be a net positive to grant them access to the tools.

Next time, take such a list and add the list items to your watchlist, or enlist the assistance of interested users to do the same.

On the positive side, I expect this is an area that can be improved upon and that a future appearance here at <s>AfD</s> RfA will have a much better chance of success; there are definitely contributions and demonstration of ability to work with here. However, the candidate specifically expresses desire to work in deletion in the answer to Q1. In addition, I note that a very high percentage of CSD-tagged articles wind up deleted (without any analysis of whether the tag was a correct one), and there are definitely ones that were tagged and the articles still exist, but that's OK because the tags were correct at the time and the articles have been re-created and/or improved.

You did make good arguments in the AfD for this article and it was kept; but still I would want to see something more impressive in terms of best contributions. The projectspace contribution record is also fairly limited, judging from [[Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Panyd]].

Statements like “…there is no policy against the use of multiple accounts, as long as they are not used abusively if my somewhat hazy recollection of policy is correct...”  and “I cannot be expected to have flawless knowledge of every policy” are honest but disconcerting.  In what other areas of policy is he hazy or lacking knowledge? <br />In the case of MrWiki, HJ has given an answer to my questions at Q8. Personally I just don’t go with all this “if you don't trust MisterWiki, trust me” stuff. At best it is naïve and at worst, posturing. Shoehorning a serial culprit back in because he does a bit of good work elsewhere and applying a cumbersome set of rules in order to achieve that objective is something I cannot support. I’m just not that desparate to have known disruptive editors back quickly, and there are  significantly more able editors than MrW. will ever be who remain banned for longer, unless they see this approach as a route back. <br />My oppose is therefore based on inadequate and to some extent casual approach to policy awareness together with a lack of objectivity which could influence his Admin. decisions."

That interaction concerns me, since there seems to be a lack of [[WP:AGF]] on your part. An editor who was quite clearly trying to improve an article instead of harm it still has a ""do not intentionally add incorrect information to articles"" warning template on his talk page despite everyone acknowledging that the change he made (which included an explanatory edit summary) was in fact correct, if initially unreferenced. Indeed, after he provided a reliable source reference, you then, rather than withdrawing or striking the ""incorrect information"" template, scolded him for ""plagiarism"" (!) for quoting the source text in the reference. Both the unsourced correction and the use of extended quoted text to support or defend a correction are typical newbie mistakes, and I think your response could have been much less [[WP:BITE]]Y. And that your response included a reference to [[plagiarism]] rather than acknowledging that the quote was properly attributed but perhaps too long a quote to qualify as fair use is also concerning.

JamesBWatson,Ling.Nut,-1,-1,2010,"14:24, 29 October 2010","'''Oppose''' First of all, it would take quite exceptional circumstances for me to be persuaded it would be beneficial to give adminship to someone who says, in effect, ""I don't have any idea what I will do with my admin tools: I will think about that when I've got the tools"". That is further reinforced when the user in question does not seem to currently be doing anything admin related, and when they actually rule out several admin areas (vandal fighting, XfD, blocking) without ruling any in. Secondly, this user is frequently contemptuous and dismissive of those he disagrees with, which is completely unacceptable for an admin. Thirdly, the user is clearly out of sympathy with Wikipedia policies and guidelines in several respects (e.g. ""I find the idea of preventing people from editing the encyclopedia anyone can edit a bit distasteful""). That would be fine if I detected a suggestion of ""I don't agree with policy X, but I will do my best to uphold it per consensus"", but I don't. Instead I see remarks such as ""CONSENSUS is wholly and completely a farce on Wikipedia ... Feel free to do the right thing at any time"" (i.e. to do ''what you personally think'' is ""the right thing"", irrespective of consensus). The whole manner and tone of many of the editors comments here and elsewhere suggest that this quote '''''is absolutely representative of the editor's approach''''', and so I fear a use of admin tools to carry out his own wishes, not to serve the community's consensus. There are other reasons for not being happy with this candidate, covered above by other commentators, but those three are the ones that I find most compelling."

True, it's possible to avoid problems to a large extent by staying away from difficult areas, but as an admin Jmcw37 will be turned to by other editors to help solve their problems and sooner or later will step into potentially stressful situations. I strongly suspect Jmcw37 was merely asking commenters to be kind and didn't intend to imply that they can't cope with stress and would rather avoid communication, but the impression has been left nonetheless.

However, one of the best indications that a person is ready for adminship is a record of ""acting like an administrator"" for some period of time before the RfA, and I don't get that feeling with Sphilbrick. A year ago, we interacted on a couple of AfDs in which his comments seemed naive and newbyish, but that was a year ago. His recent involvement with MfD shows a commitment to helping with admin-type tasks, but even his most recent comments there ([[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User:Lehla/userpage]], [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User:Geo Swan/Guantanamo/Brook DeWalt]], [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Activist]]) fail to give me a sense of a person who confidently addresses questions from the context of Wikipedia policy.

Kingpin13,The Thing That Should Not Be,-1,-1,2010,"09:49, 20 October 2010","'''Oppose''' Although I've supported The Thing at RfA previously, a number of things have changed my mind since then... I believe there are some maturity concerns here, and don’t think The Thing has the right maturity or mentality for adminship. These aren’t only based on off-wiki actions. For example, The Thing seems to concentrate way too much on his edit count, and numbers, rather than the actual quality of the work he is doing, just see [[User_talk:The_Thing_That_Should_Not_Be/Archive_7#Damn.21]] (also I don’t like that, as displayed here, The Thing is always a bit too keen to show off their work) or Q2. I think administrators should be more concerned about how well they do their work, than how much they can get done. As to maturity, his response to his last RfA (saying he was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:The_Thing_That_Should_Not_Be&diff=343146009&oldid=343145244 not going to run again] which he [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:The_Thing_That_Should_Not_Be&diff=368719693&oldid=368717147 confirmed in June]) was slightly disappointing, especially considering he is now running (on the subject of his previous RfAs, I find it poor form to repeatedly submit RfAs when nothing has changed, especially when his last RfA partly failed because nothing had changed even then. One of the concerns back then was also maturity, I particularly agree with PeterSymond’s oppose from that RfA). Also I wasn’t impressed by his response to the accidental oversighting of his edits – he knew it was being sorted out, and it would have been better for him to simply sign out, and wait until they were back, ignoring Wikipedia in the meantime. Instead he seemed to contribute to the small amount of drama which surrounded that incident (this, among other things such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:The_Thing_That_Should_Not_Be&diff=337758843&oldid=337210246 this] edit mentioned in the previous RfA, seem to suggest he doesn't handle stress particularly well). Also the response to IShadowed’s concern was immature, ironic considering that the concern was about his maturity.<br />These kinds of behavioural issues aside, I will just firstly say I (obviously) think The Thing does extremely important and generally good anti-vandalism work. But really, this is all he does. As I mentioned in Q6, none of the work he does regularly actually involves collaboration or consensus building, and this working together is extremely important for administrators in particular. Also I see no evidence of him demonstrating an ability to judge consensus, also important for an administrator. Of course, there are those users who will say ""but he only wants the tools for his anti-vandalism work"". True as this may be, I think there is more difference between blocking a user, and reporting them to AIV, or deleting a page and tagging it (the admin side of thing normally involve more explanations and justifications). Besides which, if he’s not going to use the tools for these things which actually need more administrators at the moment (AIV and CSD are well manned) then I don’t see that he needs them. He does good enough work at the moment, I say leave it at that. <br /> But really the problem for me, is I don’t trust this user to make the right decisions as an administrator, I trust that he wants to do the best for the project, but I don’t always agree with his method of doing this. It’s a real shame he hasn’t contributed any real content to the project, because doing so would allow him to much better understand the way this works, and empathise better with other users (which as mentioned earlier I see a lack of). Also the semi-automated edits are a bit of a problem, ''not'' because he is using a program, but simply because he’s allowing it to make him go a bit too fast (yes, speed is important in AV, but you need to find a balance). Making stupid mistakes and sacrificing quality for quantity as mentioned earlier (just a few examples out of many: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&diff=prev&oldid=377695762 this] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Not_now&diff=391435590&oldid=391435448 this] [[User_talk:The_Thing_That_Should_Not_Be/Archive_5#Sam_burn|and this]]).

I'm also a little disturbed when I see repeated blanking of a user's Talk page, and various warnings when I look back at the history - I know users are allowed to blank their talk pages, but I'd hope someone wanting to be trusted with a mop would be sufficiently open to preserve their history (archive pages can be used to avoid the main Talk page getting too big). Anyway, I'm rambling - if you come back when your block is old and cold and with no further warnings, and spend some time looking at other related areas and getting to know the tools and procedures available for dealing with vandalism, edit wars, and general unpleasantness, I could see myself supporting your next nomination. --"

[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Help_desk&diff=prev&oldid=366335960 This help desk response] suggests that there may be an over reliance on user talkpage templates. Although I'll give TFOWR the benefit of the doubt that the advice was general and they didn't know which ""relatively inexperienced editor"" was being discussed, it's a bit worrying that when asked which warning template would be most appropriate to put on the talkpage of someone who is editing in good faith, TFOWR's answer is to recommend a combination of Twinkle and Friendly. I would rather see a potential administrator taking the time to ''talk'' to inexperienced users (and advising others to do so). I'm also concerned with the apparent lack of content contributions. Despite regular assertions at RFA that administrators don't need to have content experience to effectively use the admin tools, I do think that it's important to have put a significant amount of effort into getting an article ''towards'' FA standard. It is, after all, why we're here and not only does it help reinforce (in one's mind) a number of important policies and guidelines, but it creates more empathy towards content creators. Other than that, there is a slightly uncomfortable feeling reading the talkpage threads that led up to this RFA, a sense of TFOWR being coerced against their humble protestations by their many fans to submit to RFA. Also (and this is not a deal breaker), the overuse of <nowiki><small></nowiki> tags gets annoying while trying to read through contributions. Are we not supposed to read those bits? Sitting on the fence for now, but will look into it further.--"

In practice, admins generally ''shouldn't'' make political statements of any kind in their userspace for exactly that reason. If they were ever needed to intervene in a dispute on the [[Fox News]] article, for example (or anything related to American conservatism), their judgement and impartiality could easily be called into question and create more trouble than it's worth.

I wanted to do this almost immediately after my support, but my internet lost connection and I haven't been able to make it back until now.

The administrator would notice that it was a wheel war, and rightly blocked both parties, while locking down the page on the version without the BLP problems-- I think this question was badly worded and is a prime example of damned if you do, damned if you don't.

This is a bit problematic, in that he's obviously working in a new area, in good faith, but failing to listen to the counsel of other admins (like, oh, me) who've worked in the area and understand precedent and consensus as applied to this particular facet of Wikipedia. This, in concert with his lack of content creation, suggests that he may in good faith end up doing a lot of damage as he expands his scope, contrary to the answer to question 1.  This is precisely the reason that administrators should have adequate content creation experience.  If VernoWhitney is confirmed, he needs to learn to rely on the advice of contributors with more experience in an area when he enters it, and if he is not promoted in this RfA, he should seek to expand his scope of interactions, such that he can use the tools effectively in any realm.  Given his polite and straightforward manner, I would be willing to support him in a future RfA once he has demonstrated content competence.

And the user is not prmarily seeking the tools for CSD, but CSD and AIV are too closely linked to be separated in the knowledge base of the candidate. Tuxedo junction could have been handled better, there are situations not covered by templating, and an Admin working in AIV needs to know when not to block well intentioned errors. Had Tuxedo made another faulty edit, would the candidate have proceeded with the threatened block? I don't issue a final warning till I'm convinced that the other user has exhausted my ability to [[WP:AGF]] and means to make unconstructive edits. Clearly Tuxedo was not at their best that day or in those discussions. ''Discussion and dialoge had begun after prior templated warnings.'' The thing to do was to put away the template machine and coach/assist/guide/continue discussion. Tuxedo was clearly outraged by prior warnings and obviously still has strong feelings on the matter. The situation needed to be defused. '''Before giving a user the ability to block vandlas, the user needs to be able to distinguish between the need for blocking and the need for assisatnce.'''

This RfA is an extension of that; it seems very well formatted to hide almost any direct reference to ''why'' you were desysopped. Arguing that somebody in the public sphere is unlikely to play around is an awful argument; you've played around in the past. Every moment as an arbitrator and administrator you didn't tell the community was violating its trust in you; every moment ''post-identification''. If identified people are unlikely to violate trust, why did you do so in the past? I see no evidence that we can trust you with the tools, and more importantly I see no recognition that you know what you did was wrong.

I also strongly agree with Recognizance's comments above: That Everyking had the decency, the respect for his fellow editors, and the guts to stand by his record, warts and all, when returned to RfA five times since 2005 speaks volumes about his trustworthiness.

But that doesn't mean that a candidate who hasn't plumbed the depths of the FA process will be unable to be a good administrator. It depends on the candidate, whether or not they communicate intelligently when the IPs complain about being reverted and templated. I need to see that the candidate can be depended upon to reply politely, patiently, and based on policy. So I looked through the candidate's talk page and talk archives.

Some people favor expanding what speedy deletion can be used for, and some people favor restricting it. Both of those are valid points of view. But people on both sides of that debate would probably agree that over-hasty use of the A1 and A3 tags, and stretchy attempts to use A7 to cover things that the template itself specifically says it does not cover, are quite common occurrences. Your answers suggest that you might not have much experience looking at [[:Category:Candidates_for_speedy_deletion|how people use speedy deletion tags at present]], and assessing whether the tagging is correct or not - something that any editor can do. Of course you are intelligent and keen and I'm sure you would learn these things quickly, but speedy deletion is very BITEy, and very difficult for new users to appeal, and a new admin with limited CSD judgement experience engaging in CSD deletions could potentially scare off quite a lot of potentially good new editors when their first experience of Wikipedia is having their good-faith, potentially-valuable new article deleted.

With such a limited overall number of edits I would want to see at least one area of clear excellence, but that is not the case here. The mainspace contribution record is too limited. Very little in terms of article creation. I looked up a few articles created by the candidate and was not impressed: [[George Boothby]] is a stub in rather poor shape; [[Park Side railway station]] and [[Winteregg]] are very short and completely unreferenced stubs. I understand that article-writing may not be your strong suit, but really, you need to bring up the articles that you do create to a better shape. Most other mainspace contributions seem to consist in vandalism reverts, maintenance tags and minor edits (correcting misspellings and the like). Gnome work is fine, but I would need to see a great deal more of it, especially in the absence of substantial article-writing. Projectspace contrib record is also fairly limited. Only 125 edits total to Wikipedia and Wikipedia talk namespaces. Speedy deletion tagging is also far from perfect. Among your CSD tags declined within last week are [[Student Choice high school]] (a degree granting institution) and [[CSU Buccaneers]] (NCAA Division I team). There are other signs showing that the candidate is not sufficiently experienced for the moment. E.g. you have uploaded a file File:Grütshalp.jpg without providing evidence of copyright permission.

For the latter, some examples include: Per PeterSymonds ""reasons"", [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/The_Thing_That_Should_Not_Be&diff=342777858&oldid=342776962 1] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Chzz&diff=322858406&oldid=322856202 2], Opposing based on the editor having a narrow areas of interest [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/TenPoundHammer_7&diff=311577176&oldid=311575698 1], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Until_It_Sleeps_3&diff=309150952&oldid=309150732 2], and opposing based on philosophical reasons without an explanation [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Nosleep&diff=304730368&oldid=304720035 1], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Cobi_4&diff=306986816&oldid=306968594 2]. Also some concerns about policy issues including [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/A_new_name_2008&diff=313143497&oldid=313131309 some misunderstandings] about new usernames (this was later retracted and this reason for opposing is minor). In the end, I don't have enough confidence about this editor's need for the tools balanced against their history and criteria regarding others having the same set of tools. I could be convinced with additional editing, and in a few months, but I'm bothered by the above."

At this time, despite your good record as an admin and arb under your present name, you should be content with being a productive editor. --'''''"

DGG,Blanchardb,-1,-1,2010,"01:16, 16 April 2010","'''Strong oppose'''  You do not seem to recognize the difference between the mere assertion f importance that is enough to pass WP:CSD, and the demonstration of notability that is required to stay in  WP article. Even after some prompting , you still don't recognize it. Given your  proposed area of concentration, this makes for an impossible situation,. The basic requirement of someone deleting speedies is to delete the right articles according to the existing narrow criteria. It's not a question of deletionism, but where and how to do the deletion.

Townlake,Thumperward,-1,1,2010,"23:31, 23 July 2010",'''Oppose''' I looked at the issues D&L and MSGJ cited; I share their concerns. The boldness that makes one a good editor doesn't necessarily translate to making one a good admin.
Malinaccier,Jerem43,-1,-1,2010,"21:15, 3 December 2010","'''Oppose'''. I came to this RfA hoping to support. I specifically remember your last RfA because I thought that you were a really good editor that just needed work with thoroughness and communication/interaction skills.  15 months is certainly a long time since then and is long enough to change or correct, but I do not think that this has happened.  Cirt's diffs show the same type of demeanor that I opposed for last time.  '''"
