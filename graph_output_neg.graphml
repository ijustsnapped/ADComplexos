to represent, about the  permissible boundaries for administrator actions. We have too many problems with admins flirting with the \
boundaries of NOT INVOLVED. We need to move way, way, in the direction of stronger enforcement of it--there are 700 admins, and \
there is almost never need for one particular admin to take an action.  I cannot see that we can possibly have an active admin who \
intends to act totally opposed to Wikipedia policy about something important, and whose nearest approach to conformity is that he \
intends to  bring questionable blocks to the noticeboard more often, not that he intends to not make questionable blocks in the \
first place. As a subsidiary point, I would consider such an answer to be the height of arrogance, except that the following q,6 & \
7, outdoes it. (even though I  agree with the actions he did take there, there were many perfectly good answers to give that would \
have said things politely).   Nobody who gave anywhere near the answers being given would have been confirmed in the first place.  \

ponder decisions carefully, and explain and discuss things with people they anger by blocking and deleting (because admins will \
inevitably anger other people - it comes with the job). And while I'm not saying that The Thing isn't capable of that, my problem \

an intelligent, capable, technically-savvy editor. I also think xe is honest. However, Sigma has behaved poorly in too many incidents. \
Sigma is to be commended for their candor in owning up (mostly) to past errors, but the time period in which xe has been editing \
is too compressed for me to have confidence that xe's reformed. Also, the problems are not related to misunderstood or misapplied \
policies or guidelines. That's just knowledge; it can be acquired and fixed. Temperament is not something so easily learned.<br>\
Two contentious areas that have been discussed here. First, the user name. Frankly, I don't understand the level of hostility toward \
Sigma's user name. Sure, it may be mildly irritating, but it shouldn't be enough to oppose. That said, I also don't understand why \
Sigma was so reluctant to accommodate the complainers. Even now, I don't completely understand what Sigma has done to \"correct\" \
the problem, but Sigma's reaction was a bit grudging and I-shouldn’t-have-to. Second, the Conservapedia issue. I agree with TP \
that we shouldn't go on a witch hunt about off-wiki behavior, but Sigma used a Wikipedia channel. These channels are not official, \
but they are related to Wikipedia and attract Wikipedians. If Sigma had used some other forum, I would feel differently, but I don'\
t approve of vandalizing websites, no matter how much you disagree with what they stand for. And I didn't appreciate Sigma's quibble \
on what constitutes vandalism. Just to be clear, I am not opposing just because of these two problems, but because of these ''and'' \
the other problems highlighted by editors, some of which have been admitted by Sigma .<br>I'll close by saying that I have an enormous \
amount of respect for many of Sigma's supporters, and I was very tempted not to vote, but I felt it would be cowardly of me to stand \
in the wings. It looks likely to me that Sigma will be nominated. If so, I wish them nothing but the best. Sometimes, the acquisition \
of administrative responsibility gives a person a new perspective. Hopefully, Sigma will pause before acting and deliberate more \
about what xe does.--",

not ''start'' at ANI.  New sysops should start at RFPP, UAA, PROD and PERM.  Areas that are the least controversial.  What this \

some difficult editors; the candidate has apparently avoided that learning experience. The desire to work in ANI is odd given edit \
stats imply < 63 edits to ANI; editors don't have to be admins to comment there. AfD is also mentioned, but the experience there \
is minimal and the main diagonal is poor. Q8 gives an explanation about using policy arguments in AfD comments, but Northamerica1000'\
s question misleads with \"congruent with other editor opinions\". The AfD stats show congruence with the closing admin's determination \
of consensus and not whether one voted with or against the crowd. That's a subtle but important distinction; policy arguments should \
trump a majority w/o policy; a poor main diagonal indicates a problem with applying policy rather than failing to follow the crowd. \
Examining some AfDs leaves me more uncomfortable; the experience/judgment is not there. For a candidate who wants to work at ANI \

latest questions, because I thought he'd begun to understand the language concerns people have expressed previously. Instead, I'\

creative than usual, Strat. That's not the problem. This is not about anyone trying to censor your creativity, or force you into \
a meaningless box, or make you toe the line. It's about ''meaning''. \"I have just returned from labor\" doesn't ''mean'' the same \
thing as \"I've just returned from work\" to most English speakers, and if you swap \"labor\" in there to mean \"my job, but also toil \
and ass bustin' and tiredness and resignation and satisfaction and an ice cream sundae\" and expect that your readers will be able \
to intuit all that subtext, rather than them just blinking in confusion and wondering if you've just had a baby or been put on a \
chain gang, you're misguided. Part of both the beauty and the frustration of English is that its vocabulary hosts far more shades \
of meaning - by virtue of it having begged, borrowed, and stolen words from so many places over so much time - than many other languages. \
Because there are these shades of meaning, you can't just...swap out words for bigger ones and think people will understand what \
you mean, because far too often for comfort what you mean and what you've ''said'' are two different things, when we can figure \
out what you've said at all (things like \"could come across for that simply change\" aren't just borked word meanings - they're not \
comprehensible English in the first place). It's one thing to write floridly, or to have a habit of nesting clauses to the point \
where eyes cross (mea culpa!). But it's another to be told multiple times, \"Look, we can't ''understand you''. Please write more \
clearly!\" and reply \"This <s>style</s> tenor of <s>writing</s> formulation is perfectly <s>good</s> congenial, and I think you're \
just <s>trying</s> bidding to to <s>censor</s> bowdlerize my <s>creativity</s> perspicacity!\" As I said, I'm sorry to be coming \

ve got tons of people in both the \"support\" and \"oppose\" camps here who are leading their votes with comments about how good your \
contributions are and how firmly they believe you're an asset to the encyclopedia. The only thing running an RFA to \"fix\" your reputation \
does is make those people, who think you're so sensible, wonder why you're so concerned about your reputation.",

using the right words; it also requires being able to use the right words to communicate full meaning. I'm very pleased to see that \
Strat has made progress on half of that, but I think the other half is still too lacking for an administrator. I am also concerned \

his impulse control. My impression is that Strat's emotions always dwell close to the surface, and that while he does his absolute \
best to be helpful and constructive, it just doesn't come out right sometimes, especially in confrontational or high-stress situations. \

have done excellent work developing article content. However, while this is admirable, it doesn't qualify an individual for adminship. \
I know one editor on Wikipedia with over 250k edits to his/her name. Less than 1.5 percent reflect communicating with others via \
user talk pages, less than .4 percent involve edits to the Wikipedia namespace, and less than .05 communicating with others in the \
Wikipedia talk space. I consider this person a valued member of the Wikipedia community. I don't mind cleaning up the articles created \
or flagging for lack of notability. That said, sometimes it's frustrating because this individual will not communicate with others, \
and displays minimal understanding and experience interpreting Wikipedia policies and guidelines. A candidate for adminship needs \
to be able to understand, interpret, and effectively communicate with others, a complex range of policies and guidelines. If an \
admin doesn't know the answers at the time, they must be able to research in order to find the answer in a timely manner. The answers \
to questions 6-8 illustrate that you are not yet able to effectively manage the basic knowledge of which all admins should have \
a firm grasp. I find in various RFAs, individuals fall on one side or the other when it comes to article creation. Admins need to \
have a sure knowledge and effective level of expertise in writing and editing content. But this is not the end of knowledge. In \
my opinion, it would be beneficial if you were to spend some time reading, reviewing, and coming to an understanding of the policies \
and guidelines regarding the basic nature of the notability guidelines, along with reliable and independent sources. Honestly, I \
don't know much about science or sports. I tend to stay away from those subjects. That said, I've reviewed the notability guidelines \
for sports and athletes and have a solid understanding of the criteria for notability. I have also formed definite opinions. The \
criteria needs to be made consistent and expanded to include more sports. Heck, I'm a chick, but for crying out loud, where's the \
boxing criteria? But I digress. In the end, press releases and university/corporate bios? Not reliable. Not independent. Established, \
regular editors or admins? Block when appropriate. Legal threats, sockpuppets, edit wars/3RR, compromised accounts, gross incivility, \
harassment, unapproved bots, and outing and/or disclosure of confidential/personal information. And if you don't know the copyright \

a minimum of 500 edits per month during the previous year. Dylan has edited over 500 times per month, only five times since September \
2007 (when he was 11 years old?). The last time was August 2009 (when he was 13? 14?). If Dylan never mentioned his age and continued \

as if a slogan is appropriate to dismiss those who are concerned about the long term effects on a volunteer community of paid advocacy (\
there is no problem with anyone, paid or not, correcting a mistake in a company article—just do it—the problem is obviously \
something else). A more substantial issue was raised by Kww above. Long term abusers are a signficant and growing problem, and those \
who loudly assert their right to restore edits by a banned user are missing the point, and possibly are not sufficiently experienced \
in that area. Of course material is good regardless of its author, and an editor with experience editing the article concerned can ''\
later'' reflect on what should occur. However, combatively proposing that it is good to undo someone who has reverted a banned user \
is not satisfactory for an admin who needs to know how to encourage good editors and discourage bad. The best way to ensure a banned \
user returns to make more trouble is to loudly defend some of their edits—if a revert really bothers you, put it on your ''to \
do'' list, read about the topic, and return to improve the article in a couple of weeks. Encouraging banned users also drives away \
good editors who work in that area.",

Ryan's work, and he has many qualities which I think would be great assets to an administrator. However, as this discussion has \
continued, more and more concerns have been brought up, and I have gradually become less secure in my support for him. I will not \
list all the concerns I have had, as most of them are already documented on this page, but I will mention a few. Ryan's handling \
of the AN/I discussion on Kiefer.Wolfowitz showed, in my opinion, a fundamental failure to understand a number of points which are \
essential for an administrator to understand. For example, he did not seem to fully grasp the need to base decisions on the whole \
of the relevant history, not just the current issue. In the same discussion he showed a quite mistaken belief that, when an editor \
has had a string of short blocks for the same kind of thing, and shows no sign of intending to change his/her decision, another, \
even shorter block, will be effective in stopping the behaviour, and therefore there is no advantage in a longer one. An administrator \
with such mistaken views of how human beings work would not be an effective one. On another AN discussion concerning reverting of \
edits by banned users, he was completely dismissive of the views of those he disagreed with, calling them \"ridiculous\", and showing \
no willingness or no ability (I can't say which) to consider their point of view. This approach is not acceptable for an administrator, \
who must be able to consider all sides of an argument. <s>Then there is Ryan's statement on this page \"it is highly inappropriate \
for you to attack a person's belief system, whether they be religious or otherwise, anywhere on Wikipedia and I respectfully ask \
for you to strike that section from your question\". The remark he referred to was inappropriate because it was irrelevant, but it \
was not an attack. An administrator, who has the power to perform such actions as summarily deleting a page as an attack page, and \
indefinitely blocking users for personal attacks, ''must'' be able to distinguish an attack from an negative opinion which is not \
an attack.</s> Then we have tagging a new stub article for speedy deletion within a minute of creation instead of waiting a while \
to see if content would be added, which does not inspire faith that, as an admin, Ryan would not rush in and delete in such a situation. \
As I said above, these are not the only concerns that I have, but they are enough, I think, to indicate that I think there are various \
areas where Ryan either lacks an understanding of points which are central to administrative work or behaves in ways that would \
not be acceptable for an administrator. Consequently, with great reluctance, I feel I have to oppose.",

vandalism, and so on. Unless you have experience in these areas, showing understanding of such matters, we have no way of knowing \

view of this issue, without even being aware that it is an issue. For example, understanding the speedy deletion criteria is a major \
issue, and assessing them in particular cases often requires a good deal of thought and care. Anyone who is not aware of that fact \
is not ready to be an administrator, especially if they have indicated that this is an area they expect to work in. You are doing \

	JamesBWatson -> Jerem43	[date=10,
		result=-1,
		text="'''Oppose''' Unfortunately there are numerous indications that this user is unclear about various areas of policies and procedures. \
Also, several of the answers to  questions are too general, and avoid really indicating what the candidate's views are, in some \
cases leaving me wondering if they have any views. For example, the response to question 5 doesn't answer \"When should you block \
a user who was received no warnings?\" Yes, it says that \"It would require a truly, blatantly wrong act or serious infraction\", but \
it gives absolutely no indication whatsoever what the candidate thinks would be such a \"truly, blatantly wrong act or serious infraction\"\
. Presumably we all know that it would have to be something serious, but to me the question is asking for an indication of specifically \
what would be serious enough, and the candidate makes no attempt at all to tell us. The answer to question 4 suggests a readiness \
to unblock by default \"unless there was a distinct pattern of vandalism in the history\". I would certainly want to ask the user \
requesting the unblock for further information than just \"I will be good in future\". Also, while \"If the address were a shared address \
from a school\" then the candidate is right to \"encourage him/her to create an account\", but wrong to think that one should, in general, \
also unblock for the whole school. I am also not sure about unblocking \"unless there was a distinct pattern of vandalism in the \
history\". If there was no pattern of vandalism then why was the IP blocked in the first place? The answer to question 9 suggests \
a lack of clarity as to the distinction between a ban and a block. Yes, I accept that it is possible to make a slip and use the \
wrong word, but (1) the question asked about banning, and to say \"oh, I was answering the question as though it meant blocking, \
and only wrote 'ban' by a slip\" is really not good enough. Also, \"ban\" appears three times in the answer, which seems unlikely unless \
the candidate is not really all that clear about the difference. An admin should be 100% clear about those two being different concepts. \
The candidate indicates an interest in playing an administrative role in ANI, but admits to having taken very little part there \
hitherto. Watching and not taking part is helpful, but does not provide any evidence as to how the candidate would perform there. \
Likewise the candidate indicates an interest in playing an administrative role in AIV, but I can find very little vandalism-related \
work in the candidate's edit history. My experience of working at AIV indicates that even among experienced Wikipedians there are \
many who have quite mistaken ideas about how AIV is to be used, and it is essential that ''every'' admin who works there has a thorough \
grasp of procedure. Those are just a few samples of my concerns, and unfortunately there are many others, several of which have \
already been discussed above by others. (e.g. the answer to Question 6, and doubts about the candidate's temperament.) Some of the \
concerns are fairly minor, but there are just too many of them. My overall feeling is that the candidate is rather vague about the \
whole question of what being an administrator involves. It's a pity, because we are dealing with an editor with many strong points, \
but unfortunately some weaknesses in areas which are of great importance to admin work.",

Logan (a) has not shown himself to have good judgement in this field and (b) that he ''has'' shown himself to be overeager and perhaps \
inclined to jump in without preparation. As Jorgenev has said, most of Logan's AfD related contributions - that is, contributions \
to a field he wishes to work in, by his own admission - are Non-Admin Closures (NACs). This is an important job which keeps backlogs \
down, ensures the regular and steady flow of <s>currency<s> edits and is generally A Good Thing, and I applaud Logan for the very \
admin-like attitude of being willing to get his hands dirty. The bigger problem is that this means he's got no way of showing that \
he has good judgement in this field; NACs are, by definition, those AfDs where the decision made is \"there is no decision made\". \
Logan's counter-argument doesn't actually address that point, instead providing an excuse for why he can't show he's got good judgement. \
However, it's a bit cruel to hold a standard of \"he must positively prove he's got good judgment\", which is where my second point \
exacerbates the issues with his actions; to summarise, he has a habit of jumping into things without heeding the advice of others. \
As an example, this RfA. Logan has spent the past few months (somewhere between 3 and 6) pestering me to nominate him for RfA. I \
reviewed his contributions, and one of the concerns I cane up with is \"you need to actually contribute to more AfDs so we can see \
evidence of your judgment\". As we can see, he didn't heed that advice; instead, he decided to simply go it alone without the support \
of me or anyone else. His statement that he was \"reluctant to be considered for the job\" is a blatant falsehood give that he's spent \
between a quarter and a half of the year asking others to support him in this endeavour. Despite this, when the support failed to \
materialise, he went ahead. Together with the AfD actions, this strikes me as the actions of someone with a tendency to jump into \
a mess when he feels he's ready for it, ''regardless of what other people are saying'', and that kind of gung-ho attitude is only \
useful in an administrator (someone who has the implicit support of the community for his judgement) and is not at ''all'' useful \

experience in content creation. If Calabe were to stick completely to anti-vandalism and nothing else, this would be less of a problem; \
however, adminship is universal and such a promise at an RfA is essentially meaningless. Some experience in article creation is \
necessary for a large amount, if not all, of admin work. Lack of article creation would have been less of a problem if there was \
evidence of very good communication and dispute resolution, but that seems to be lacking too. Indeed, when working with anti-vandalism, \
especially when deciding whether or not to block a user, the ability to discuss things with other people is of the utmost importance. \
Dealing with AIV reports and RPP, an admin will often have to discuss things with other editors and an admin needs to be able to \
both communicate why they have taken certain action and to help other users work collaboratively. Good experience in dispute resolution \
or other areas of communication would have nullified the content creation issue. However, with little experience in content creation \

admins need to master. I don't think that admins need to have or be involved in our audited content, feel free to give an example \

breaking 3RR after being warned once, violating a topic ban or other sanction, there are numerous reasons to block a person before \

it a very good indicator of a person's experience. The next question is also a problem; despite the sockpuppetry, the good-faith \

be best to try to engage the editor before taking further action (they might also not know about block evasion and sockpuppetry \

Basically the reason I'm in oppose is that many of the opposes above give very really and concerning reasons, and together, they \
culminate in me not having enough confidence in you to have the tools. As an atheist myself, I can see why you have the userbox \
in question and personally I don't believe it is enough to warrant an outright oppose, but the confrontational manner in which you \
responded does concern me, especially the claims that it was kept at MfD so it is clearly fine. The fact that it even went to MfD \
should give you an indication that at least some people find it offensive. The sig issue concerns me very slightly, as I struggle \
to read it and find it unnecessarily colourful. Also (although you clearly don't mean it to), it does appear very MySpace-y. I must, \
however, say that I was pleased to note your removal of the confrontational user talk header. For me though, there are three main \
reasons why I'm in oppose. Firstly, that you needed to be told (whether it was in a roundabout manner or not) that you had missed \
the 3RR on Q6. This is partially Sven's fault, as you may have realised yourself without prompting, but you never got the opportunity \
and now it simply looks as if you forgot (or worse, didn't know) until you were told. Secondly, the incorrect non-admin closure. \
It's not really the decision you reached (yes, it should have been kept) but that you \"supervoted\" that it was your opinion that \
he passed the GNG, rather than saying that the consensus was that he passed the GNG (the AfDs Coucelles points out are also troubling)\
. Finally, and in my opinion most importantly, are Mkativerata's copyvio concerns. As he says, you only fixed the problems that \
were identified in March and didn't take the initiative to fix your other copyvio problems before they again had to be raised in \
September. Although all of these concerns are obviously forgivable in the case of an editor, they are not so in the case of a prospective \

Anyone can slap a CSD tag on. Very often articles that need to go are tagged wrongly - either wrong criterion or CSD when they should \
be prod. Some should stay, possibly needing help. If you don't have a reasonable amount of experience tagging and watching the resulting \
admin action and on occasions querying it - how are you going to decide which are right and which are wrong? When I started CSD \
tagging, I got knocked back on quite a few. I took note and increased my accuracy. Copyright is another tricky area. What is public \
domain, what is licensed and what ain't? Some people think that because the US Govt stuff is public domain, other Govt stuff will \
be. UK isn't - but it may be licensable. It may not. And closing a contentious AfD is another matter altogether. It may just be \
that you over-emphasised this sort of work in your answer to Q1, or under-emphasised your potential contribution in other areas. \
It's not easy to face not just one quizmaster but possibly dozens. I'm not worried about lack of content addition. Every publisher \
needs authors. Every publisher also needs editors and proof-readers, and someone to sort the recycling stuff. If this goes in your \
favour, I'll welcome you and offer what help a new mopholder himself can give. If if doesn't, spend more time in CSD and XfD (and \

		text="'''Oppose'''.  Let me start by saying that Steven has made outstanding contributions to the project as an editor.  That said, I \
just can't bring myself to trust him with the mop.  And I am not sure that mere passage of time will change that (i.e., some comments \
about coming back in 6 months, etc.)  It's not just the 2008 incident.  Everyone makes mistakes.  But while Steven was the only \
editor involved who was not a sysop at the time, he was experienced enough to know better.  But, as Steven seems to realize now, \
he made things much worse for himself than the involved admins did by being less than truthful during the discussion about the incident, \
sharing private emails, etc.  But that reaction is a bigger problem than the account sharing mistakes that led to the incident.  \
If Steven was less than truthful then, and willing to do more things he knew he wasn't supposed to do in order to save his skin, \
then how can I believe things will be any different in a stressful situation now?  Well, maybe he learned his lesson over time.  \
But if there is one lesson from the incident that should not have required any time to learn, it should have been \"don't share accounts.\"  \
But then that is what seemed to happen on Simple, even if no edits were made.  And there seemed to be less than truthfulness - or \
at least less than candidness again - when trying to get the ban overturned.  And then again during the 2009 RfA, when some of these \
issues went undisclosed until other editors brought them up.  Perhaps, as Steven writes in his disclosure, he has matured and learned \
his lesson, and we should be able to trust him now.  Perhaps.  But he was supposedly mature enough to become an admin even back \
in 2008, when a number of editors stated they were prepared to nominate him shortly.  And it seems like he had trouble learning \
his lessons from the incident.  And trust lost through lack of truthfulness (as opposed to an honest mistake or error in judgment, \
like the one that started the whole thing) is much harder to regain, even through the passage of time, especially when the lack \
of candor and truthfulness has been repeated several times in the interim (even if perhaps not recently).  The bottom line for me \

I knew and held in high esteem and asked if I would accept an RfA nomination, I thought I was ready for anything adminship could \
throw at me. I was certainly competent enough to mash the buttons, but I had no idea of the subtleties of adminship, and those subtleties \
are the reason we don't have monkeys to mash the buttons so we can focus on the encyclopaedia. Adminship is much more about tact, \
diplomacy, and judgement, and in this context, those things only come from well-rounded experience. My best advice would be to do \
what you enjoy doing, not do anything solely because it would look good in an RfA, and try to gain an understanding of as many areas \
of the project as possible (particularly images and copyright more generally, as that is an area of particular importance in which \
it seems you lack experience). After six months or a year doing that (and there really is no rush), if you still want to be an administrator, \

say here, because you can't respond to it without appearing to prove my point, so I apologise), and you, perhaps inadvertently, \
escalate the situation. This leads to things like the socking, and the so-called \"ragequitting\" and to many of the other issues \
that have got you into trouble. I could support a candidate with that in his history (although with you it's rather too recent history \
right now), if that underlying hot-headeness had been resolved, but it isn't something that's going to go away overnight. Thus, \
it's with regret that I have to say that you're not suited to adminship, at least not for the foreseeable future. However, I am \
familiar with your work at MILHIST, and I have always respected you for that, and I hope you'll continue the good work you do after \

RfA.  Having a user box that says, \"I'm xxx\" is ok.  Having a dozen saying \"I'm xxx\" starts pushing it into the land of advocacy---especially \

admin can look at an issue that he is interested in and knowledgable about and provide guidance that is accepted as objective--even \

though it was factual and had significant public interest--and he did so by seeking to expeditiously foreclose the possibility of \
a thorough discussion by deleting the subject content without allowing it to remain for others to view and comment, specifically \
the editors who actually had a vested interest in the article given that they had actually created it.  Aside from the few editors \
that came to his aid, Qwyrxian really took control over the future of the article irrespective of the discouraging effect it had \

have the subject content remain for the time being in order to give a full opportunity for others who had worked on the article \

intervention in, say, an LGBT or religion issue where I needed pro-LGBT/anti-religion support, but not otherwise. As a content editor \

come across White Shadows in a number of venues, mostly related to Did You Know where he puts in a lot of time and effort. Besides \
this I see from his contributions that he does a lot of anti-vandal work and his editing in the area of ships and submarines is \
laudable, even if, as Ed has pointed out above, the work is usually sufficient to just pass at DYK or GA. Overall his edits show \
a definite positive trend away from the blocks of his early career. However, I believe that this improvement was down to a number \
of respected editors (gently and not so gently) pushing White Shadows away from areas of drama, and encouraging him to spend more \
time building the encyclopedia. White Shadows, as Begoon says above, has a tendency to jump in \"feet first\", particularly when there \
is some sort of drama going on (besides the Tan incident mentioned above, this also manifests itself in his poor spelling which \
could easily be addressed if White Shadows paused for a minute or two to read back a comment, rather than rushing in and hitting \
the save button) and this leads to escalation of the situation and increasing conflict. By becoming an admin, White Shadows would \
be pushed back directly into the path of high drama, whether he wanted to be or not. An admin should <s>diffuse</s> defuse a situation, \
not make it worse, and this is where White Shadows would fall down. I believe that this will very quickly result in White Shadows \
getting into the same kind of trouble as earlier in the year. White Shadows is a promising editor but I think becoming an admin \
at this time is too early and would cause too many problems (both for WS and for en.wikipedia). tl;dr You are doing a good job and \
improving month on month. Focus on your content-related skills, improving the encyclopedia and working on \"looking before you leap\" \
