Next Paige,Dysprosia,1,1,2003,"21:39, 27 Aug 2003","Support.  Good work editing, stays NPOV, polite, etc.  I agree that anyone already doing so much housekeeping/clean-up would probably be a helpful admin.  Although only a member for a while, the contribution record speaks for itself."
Menchi,Cyan,1,1,2003,,"Support: Seen him copyediting and updating materials around, and he seems to be the ""light housekeeper"" type. --"
Arwel Parry,Pakaran,1,1,2003,"16:13, 5 Dec 2003",Support. Seems a sensible contributor.

Menchi,Jdforrester,1,1,2003,,"Support: I read his entire [http://www.jdforrester.org/biography.shtml biography], admittedly short, to see if he's a sicko. And apparently he's not. Just ''another'' computer scientist geek (Yes, probably like ''you''!) who likes to walk around (probably stalking people!!) and studies in the department of a renowned university. Although he seems to have a minor Anglocentric tendency, and a weird one at that, to spell our name as ""Wikip[a]edia"" on his webpage. :-D <br> He's a [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]]. WP doesn't explain their ideology, but assuming from the name, it's not a racist, homophobic crap-party? (No idea) <br> In addition to his seeming intelligent and unbiased life, he writes pretty good too. I like his one-paragraph explanation of the the Brit secondary education system, very encyclopedic. <br> So, I'd say he'll make a good admin so he can do those tweaks he'd like. --"

Fantasy,Jwrosenzweig,1,1,2003,"11:47, 21 Aug 2003",Support. [[User_talk:Fantasy#Thanks!]] and other of his actions/comments indicate that he would make a great addition to Wikipedia Adminship. And: I could not find nealy any thing he did without Summary. I like that ;-) --

Menchi,J.J.,1,1,2003,,"Support: '''''However''''', you have a bad tendency to not describe anything about some of the photos you've uploaded (a specific source, that is). If you become an admin, you need to correct that obvious flaw, or other people will think that even an admin do such a thing, then they can do it too. (I trust that you're uploading non-copyrighted images, but but others can easily make that claim to, and why should we trust somebody we don't know on serious matter like this?) Admins can make mistakes (we all can), but we must follow clear policies, such as copyright/copyleft attribution. --"
