Some answers are on point; number 1, for example, is clear. Others seem to miss the question or are too terse to evaluate. Number 2 asked for ""best"", but the answer seems to be ""all"". Number 5B doesn't say why. Number 7 is slightly off; the follow on didn't help. (And snaps to 28bytes for the Q.) The nom acceptance is long and anticipatory and almost argumentative. I think an admin's interests can be narrow; breath and quantity are commendable, but I'd like to see some depth and understanding. I poked around some contribs; I didn't see anything bad, but a deletion discussion made me wonder if you want to debate everyone who disagrees with you. My problem is the answers to the questions.

The answers to questions show he understands what is going on (BTW, Q10 BLP is an explicit exception at [[WP:NOT3RR]]). He is a solid candidate. I looked at the challenged CSD tags above, and his tagging is a cause for concern. His answer to question 4 was reassuring on that matter and showed self reflection and a willingness to change. The offer to abstain from CSD for a time shows both sophistication and judgment -- characteristics admins should have. His responses are strong enough to waive the CSD issue. I'm all set to support, but I took another look at his contributions and found today's [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/WireDoo&diff=488100957&oldid=488097709 keep vote] at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/WireDoo AfD/WireDoo]. This AfD vote was made after the CSD discussion here. ""I agree that it is weak, in alpha stage, not open to the public, and may never come to fruition, but when CNN and the LA Times cover it and do so in a significant way, it seems to be notable."" I have trouble with the premise that something that is still under wraps is notable. It can happen, but it would be unusual. Furthermore, I don't see CNN's spare 5 paragraphs being significant coverage.[http://articles.cnn.com/2011-10-20/tech/tech_web_mc-hammer-search-engine_1_search-engine-mc-hammer-google?_s=PM:TECH] The LA Times blog is an interview that mostly quotes WireDoo's MC Hammer.[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/10/mc-hammer-wiredoo-deep-search-engine.html] Consequently, the source is not independent; it is essentially a live press release. Where the LA times strays from quoting MC Hammer, it is skeptical of WireDoo's chances -- suggesting that WireDoo will crash and burn rather than be significant. The articles exist because MC Hammer is famous. Products and services don't acquire notability by association. That one AfD vote spins me around. I'm now reluctant to waive the CSD tagging issue and am left wondering about his [[WP:N]] judgment. The metric is not abusing the tools, and that requires good judgment. I think the proper action is to wait."

I also am personally grateful for the help you have given me in the [[Sexually transmitted disease]] article - thank you so much for your input. However, I overall must oppose your adminship at this time. I feel that admins are public figures and they need to have the ability to explain Wikipedia especially to new users. I recommend filling out your userpage. If you are an admin then people, especially new users having their first contact with Wikipedia, will look to you as a model. Your userpage is almost blank and I feel that this indicates a lack of participation in the Wikipedia community, regardless of whether that is true. Please make a userpage so that if you posted on a new user's talk page informing them about copyright violations as you said you intend to continue doing (and new users are the mostly likely targets), then when they come to your userpage to see who you are they learn more about the lesson you are trying to teach and the work you are doing on Wikipedia.<br/>Because of your limited experience and your heavy editing in one area, I feel that you are not going to be able to give sysop-level input on the majority of issues which arise. Edit count does not matter but it does take some amount of editing to get exposure to community interaction. You have not made 2500 article edits and your most extensive edits have been to bring two articles ([[Engkanto]] from 2008 and [[Carl Jackson (caddie)]] from 2010) from stub class to start class, and very little of what you do actually involves conversations with other users. I do not know what threshold of experience I am expecting from sysops but you have not met it. <br/>It was in October 2011 that you participated in this tiring discussion on [[talk:Contact fuze]]; you did nothing wrong except that I think you could have been a lot more efficient and done more to de-escalate invalid arguments if you had been more experienced. I would love to support you next year after which time surely you will have more experience.

Edit count doesn't really matter a whole lot, sometimes people want to have a life outside Wikipedia. Per Julian. The opposes all seem like weak reasons. The answer to Q8 looks correct to me, and believe it or not, some people like to have a life outside of Wikipedia. 3,000 changes is, in reality, a lot. Anybody who makes 3,000 changes to a ""normal"" encyclopedia would surely be able to do things that the administrators here can do. The fact that nowadays you have to have 10k+ edits to even be ''considered'' for adminship bothers me. Quantity < Quality."

I do see a lot of good work from this candidate, and I place a great deal of faith in the wisdom of the co-nominators. But I also see that the user's involvement at ANI has spiked since early March. Now, ANI is quite busy, and it's likely that an editor working his way toward adminship would get involved in areas that involve admins - like ANI. ANI is also the candidate's most edited Wikipedia-space page, with routine edits dating back to early 2011. So involvement there isn't a recent thing, but it feels like all of a sudden I'm seeing a lot of comments from this editor at ANI - and, indeed, 170 of the candidate's last 250 Wikipedia-space edits are to ANI, all in the last 15 days. That's not good, that's not bad - but it gives me pause. I want to support, but I also want to take the time to look into the candidate a bit more. I cite the observer effect because of the impression that the candidate's behavior changed when his RFA was imminent and ongoing - in other words, when the world was watching.

Additionally, an interest in closing AfD's has been expressed, but the candidate has participated in less than 100 AfD's, which in my opinion is not enough to grasp the intricacies of AfD required to make an effective closer (user also has no non-admin closures).  In closing, the candidate has been around for a long time and clearly is familiar with Wikipedia, and I think I would be more apt to support if the candidate showed more interest in Wikipedia by contributing regularly to areas of interest."

Also, he states he only wants to do ""snow keeps and closes according to consensus"" on AfDs, which in my opinion, snow keeps can be left to non-admins very well, and the easy consensus ones too, whereas he doesn't seem ready to make hard decisions that are needed of an administrator. His replies in terms of involvment also cause some concern from me. I have no doubt that if he is obviously involved he would recuse himself, but he states ""If another administrator would think I was involved"" which leads me to believe he isn't able to make the decision himself, which I feel is needed in an administrator.

It's not just about the intent (or lack of the same) to canvass, but about being able to judge good form from bad form. And Mabdul's quit-message publicizing the RfA is perhaps a momentary lack of judgment that should not have been committed, especially when the matter is about one's RfA. Twice this year, I've seen RfAs being troubled by issues of canvassing. In the previous incident, the canvasser was the nominator himself. This time, it's unfortunately Mabdul. I personally feel the community needs to adjudicate strongly on canvassing - either accept all kinds of canvassing or prohibit it completely... Apart from the canvassing issue, going through [[Arena (web browser)]], which Mabdul says is his best article, I perceive a preponderance of material based purely on primary sources, sps, questionable sources and some evidently unreliable sources (I think I also viewed somewhere within the article material based on 'Letters to the editor'; I may be wrong on this though). There are of course some definite reliable sources too; but my interest is waylaid by the emphasis on primary sources. As it stands currently overall, I have to oppose this candidacy.

I think the answer, above, to the standard question about disputes, is disingenuous in its claim that there have been no disputes worth bringing up. The candidate does have a prickly side. That, by itself, would not make me oppose. But part of being trusted with the tools is knowing one's limitations, and trying to pretend that those limitations don't exist just isn't good enough.

What he should have also done was tell the user in a nice way where they were going wrong ([[User talk:Fsimeski#Article on you|someone else later did that]]). In a similar vein, he left {{oldid|User talk:Twehringer thesociety|oldid=528036814|label=this welcome message}} for a user, but didn't advise them that their username was promotional/organizational and thus in violation of [[WP:username policy|username policy]], or report it at [[WP:UFAA]].

The thing that most concerns me is that the candidate does not appear to have engaged in that much collaborative discussion, as could be shown by content creation, dispute resolution or similar areas. My reasons for this are similar to ItsZippy's in the oppose section above. This is not enough for me to oppose outright, as I think the project would undoubtedly benefit from more vandal-fighter admins, and I am sure Calabe would continue to work at the high standard that he has been doing.

You do, by the way, seem like a great editor. But ""great editor"" and ""decent administrator"" do not require the exact same set of skills. The minute you have the tools, you have them all. The reason for that is that generally you ''need'' them all, or at least most of them, to be effective as an admin. When confronted with a situation where protection is requested, the admin needs to be able to decide if semi protection, full protection, blocking some users, or no action at all is the correct response. (FYI getting involved in the dispute yourself is ''not'' an administrative action, and once you've done so you can't act as an admin in that situation per [[WP:INVOLVED]]) I don't think you have much experience in admin related areas, and I think part of the reason for that is that you don't want to. That's fine, not everyone needs to be an admin, we can use all the good content editors we can get. If you decide you actually want to do this, I'm sure you could acquire the needed experience in admin-related areas over the next few months. I'm not entirely opposed to specialist admins but handing out a mop to a user with little experience in policy matters so that they can correct grammar on one particular protected page is asking a bit much."

Considering dispute/interaction, reading over the answers to the questions, I get the feel they're from reading and knowing the policies, not from experience of being involved in those policies, and I really can't tell how SwisterTwister would actually handle difficult interactions, stress, etc. There isn't the depth of understanding that comes from experience, and I think experience is the only way to grok how people feel about their content, understand why disputes can get heated, and learn how to deal with them.

These were designed to establish a couple of things; first to see if the candidate knows when to stop flogging a dead horse and second to determine what hastened their decision to present for RFA. The second point has been fully answered by the candidate and supported by their respected nominator. I expect an Admin candidate to have good content development experience, clear knowledge of policy, the support of editors who’s opinions I respect and a manner & style which demonstrates their ability to convince editors to modify their position when dealing with disputes. I encountered this candidate in a discussion relating to a proposition to introduce minimum edit thresholds for RFA candidates. He was a leading advocate. I challenged the proposal, as indicated in Q5. The ability to recognise when you are wrong is important for all of us. Entrenched views are at the heart of most disputes and the ability of an Admin to see all points of view and persuade intransigent editors towards an alternative is essential. That requires sound judgement. If the candidate cannot be convinced to drop their support of such a poor, intellectually deficient idea as minimum edit thresholds I do not consider their judgement to be yet adequate."

The first sentence of [[WP:V]] reads ''In Wikipedia, verifiability means that people reading and editing the encyclopedia can check that information comes from a reliable source.'' Somehow along the way, we have added the caveat ""unless you don't feel like it"" to the end of that extremely important line. Nowhere in the policy do I read that it's okay to ignore verifiability if you are new. Nowhere do I read that it's okay to let verifiability slide because we wouldn't want to scare a new user away from the project. The candidate did not make this revert in a bitey manner. He did it with a template which very clearly explained what the issue was and how to resolve it.

I think the biggest risk is that his zeal will get the better of him, resulting in hasty and ill-considered actions (which I suspect is at least part of the reason behind the CSD tags mentioned below).

We have enough of a track record to know that she isn't a trouble-maker. In large part, she will probably end up being able simply to be more helpful at DYK, and she is unlikely to break RFPP. I could agree with opposition on the basis of a lack of dedication to the intricacies of admin policies and procedures, if a candidate were planning to use those procedures the ways most admins do. But I don't see opposing a candidate simply because they haven't supplicated sufficiently.

I get the feeling that, if he could block some users in certain cases, he would do it well. I have, however, two concerns. Firstly, as has been mentioned, he has incredibly little experience in content creation. If Calabe were to stick completely to anti-vandalism and nothing else, this would be less of a problem; however, adminship is universal and such a promise at an RfA is essentially meaningless. Some experience in article creation is necessary for a large amount, if not all, of admin work. Lack of article creation would have been less of a problem if there was evidence of very good communication and dispute resolution, but that seems to be lacking too. Indeed, when working with anti-vandalism, especially when deciding whether or not to block a user, the ability to discuss things with other people is of the utmost importance. Dealing with AIV reports and RPP, an admin will often have to discuss things with other editors and an admin needs to be able to both communicate why they have taken certain action and to help other users work collaboratively. Good experience in dispute resolution or other areas of communication would have nullified the content creation issue. However, with little experience in content creation or active communication, I cannot support."

DGG,Bbb23,-1,1,2012,"05:10, 20 July 2012","We all agree WP content must have sources.  The proper approach to dealing with unsourced content in general is to try to source it,  if it appears reasonable. If its a field one can't work on, there are thousands of other   editors. Content should be removed if it is unsourceable, but one can only tell that after making an adequate effort. This is much harder to do that one would imagine if one does not have experience actually looking.  It's necessary to remove content  that is unsourced negative allegations about living persons, but even here if it quickly sourceable, that's even better. The difference is that if it is not quickly sourceable, instead of leaving it for someone else to source, we remove it. We need admins who know the difference, and it's a matter of practice as much as policy.The over-rigid application of BLP policy is frequent a cause of biased writing as the over-lax interpretation of it.  The need for sourcing is one of the reasons we should require significant article writing experience in admins--so they will know in practice how to find sources.  The justifications given here for removing content  leave me with the feeling that the candidate is coming here with a cause to bring about his own interpretation of policy, and  intends to try to shift consensus. The way to shift consensus is not by admin actions: admins need to act according to the ordinary consensus, and if there need be a change, let the community decide it, either explicitly, or by a shift in the result of decisions.  We need more good administrators. We do not need more administrators we are unsure of and will have to watch--we have all to many of them already.'''"

As for other reasons, per Worm That Turned and Thumperward, I wonder about the lack of transparency on the user's talk page (why not fix that immediately as a show of good faith?), and I think the answer to Q16 (on his AfD pattern) shows a lack of understanding of his own biases. Similarly, the response to Q1 seems like a brain dump, rather than a deliberative synthesis of ideas. I'm conflicted about the candidate's edit rate to the extent that it represents content (which ought to be deliberate) rather than antivandalism (which ought to be responsive), but admittedly, edit volume is likely a good indicator of familiarity with the inner workings of the project.

Question 7 is a difficult question, yet I value it a lot. The rules-based approach from Crisco is understandble, yet insufficient. There is simply more than the letter of policy to go by. Judging a candidate on RfA is hard, and pretty much the only question I ask myself at an RfA is ""does this editor [[grok]] Wikipedia, and does he grok [[WP:IAR|the prime directive]]. The answer here, I think, is almost, but not quite, which is a minus. Then to me the candidate made a mistake on Q12/13. Editors make mistakes, administrators make mistakes, god knows I made mistakes and will continue to make mistakes in the future, and I certainly hope that we don't think there is any chance in hell that we will ever have an administrator or editor for that matter that won't make mistakes. So the candidate makes a mistake in tagging an article for speedy deletion. That's bad, don't do that again, carry on, and go be an administrator. The problem to me here is that the answer to Q12/13 wasn't: I was lazy, I didn't check, shame on me. The problem is that the answers give the impression of trying to find justification in a bad action by bringing in the rules, demonstrating that it's not such a bad action. Potentially the atmosphere we have created at RfA is to blame, where one can't make a mistake (I could be judged to be doing the same here, in my defence, I intentionally left the door back open with Q13 to fix the IMO insatisfactory response to Q12). Potentially we treat our editors to such a harsh introduction to the rules that their importance gets inflated. Likely this is more the fault of the community shaping our editors in the wrong direction than it is Crisco's getting shaped by it. But in the end, I can't claim I would like this candidate to be an administrator without this natural feel for how rules should work here."

The candidate should've given it a year of good editing with their history. There is not a single nominator up there that I would say is prone to mistakes, but it seems to me that the number of nominators reflects that this candidate knew the RFA would be controversial (or he just has a ton of love =D) and it almost seems to me to be more about testing the waters to see where the candidate stands in the community. I can't support at this time when the candidates return itself is controversial. I do support the candidates return and I think the issue of copyright violations is long, old and buried. The candidate knows better now. If it were still Feb 12 then I'd say it has to be shown they know better.

The only report he made to AIV this year was also completely improper as well, to an [[User talk:216.124.255.23|IP]] who had only made two edits and was not warned for either of them before the candidate filed a report to block.

First, having only 4.5 months of active editing is too early for asking for an admin hat. Second, like several other opposers above, I am concerned about the current focus of the candidate on the part of the project (CVUA) that emphasizes the social networking aspect rather than actual encyclopedia building. To me that alone is already a significant negative. E.g., in the candidate's preferred area of admin-related activity (vandalism fighting), his contrib record shows only 20 edits to [[WP:AIV]] and 24 edits to [[WP:RPP]], with several hundred edits to CVU pages and subpages. Finally, while I do not necessarily expect  ""50 GAs, 10 FAs, and 200 DYKs"", I do want to see some substantive evidence of content-creating work from any RfA candidate. After all, this project is supposed to be mainly about building an encyclopedia. For now the highest number of edits that the candidate has to any individual article page is 9, to [[MetaLab, Ltd.]], an article that the candidate created. The article is rather stubby and its current quality strikes me as sub-par, maybe even AfD-able. The article has 4 references total: references 2 and 3 are primary refs to the MetaLab site itself. Ref no. 4 redirects here[http://pixelunion.net/] - not quite sure what that is, but does not strike me as [[WP:RS]] and again looks like a primary source based on ""Meet the designers"" note at the bottom of the page. The only third-party ref (ref no 1) is to this site[http://bestwebgallery.com/2009/07/14/metalab-design/], which again does not strike me as passing [[WP:V]]. Like I said, I don't expect 50GAs from an RfA candidate, but I do expect something significantly better and more substantive in terms of content creation than the above example demonstrates."

If a candidate wants to do copyright work then I would expect evidence of participation at [[WP:SCV]], [[WP:CP]], [[WP:CCI]] etc or evidence that they have a good record of tagging copyright violations for speedy deletion. This candidate has no such participation and hasn't tagged any copyright violations for deletion (or any pages at all, for that matter), and the answer to Q5 isn't encouraging.

HJ Mitchell,Lord Roem,-1,-1,2012,"18:38, 12 June 2012","'''Oppose'''. Please forgive me if this sounds big-headed, it's meant as a (sort-of) compliment. This RfA reminds me a lot of my first RfA—I had a bit of experience under my belt, a few thousand edits, I was enthusiastic, and when I was approached by an admin I knew and held in high esteem and asked if I would accept an RfA nomination, I thought I was ready for anything adminship could throw at me. I was certainly competent enough to mash the buttons, but I had no idea of the subtleties of adminship, and those subtleties are the reason we don't have monkeys to mash the buttons so we can focus on the encyclopaedia. Adminship is much more about tact, diplomacy, and judgement, and in this context, those things only come from well-rounded experience. My best advice would be to do what you enjoy doing, not do anything solely because it would look good in an RfA, and try to gain an understanding of as many areas of the project as possible (particularly images and copyright more generally, as that is an area of particular importance in which it seems you lack experience). After six months or a year doing that (and there really is no rush), if you still want to be an administrator, that would be a good time to think about running again. But don't be too disheartened—I don't think anybody doubts your commitment to the project or the sincerity of your offer to take on additional responsibility."

I would expect any extreme deletionist ''or'' inclusionist admin to be wary of XfD or other deletion-related tasks, since strong emotion is the enemy of a good decision when it comes to keep/delete choices. Refusal to stay away from tasks where one is very prone to emotional/ideological involvement is a dealbreaker, and resigning from the ARS because people think your membership is evidence of poor judgment doesn't actually do anything to fix concerns about that judgment."

And linking it here, in your answer, assumes the users who have come to evaluate your nomination need the link for understanding as well. Normally I would not oppose on these grounds alone, but I was already reluctant based on your level of content creation. I am uncomfortable supporting a user for administrator when it bundles so many user rights that the candidate would be unlikely to obtain if they were requested individually. I do not believe you would be granted autopatrolled if a request was weighed against your contributions. In total, the sum is inadequate for me to believe you are an example of editor that ought to be fast-tracked to administrator, with normal requisites for permissions waived, because of your demonstrated potential.

Q6 in particular was bothersome since those comments weren't personal attacks, just incivility, which it is best to ignore the incivility and simply tell them you aren't getting involved in the ''content'' of the discussion, just the tone.  Getting defensive isn't helpful when you are coming in as an admin.

There is no doubt you do some good things for Wikipedia and I appreciate and respect that, but being an admin requires a little more objectivity and tolerance than I think you are prepared for.

I don't know if you were trying to hide the criticism you got at the AfD for changing the article topic entirely by starting it as a completely new article mid-AfD or what.  It's OK to make mistakes, but you need to own them, not try to hide them.  The way you source dump in AfDs leaves a bad taste in my mouth as well, since many times the sources don't contain much more than a passing mention.  I don't think you are a bad editor, but you need to consider that every time we keep a poor article based on AfD source dumping, that's basically assigning work to other editors that are going to have to maintain an article that will likely forever remain poorly sourced."

As I started looking over the RfA, I did a double-take when I read JamesBWatson's support statement, because I had previously been unaware of the block and the history accompanying it. Consequently, I decided to give this a couple of days more thought – and I find myself ending up with the same opinion as JamesBWatson. <small>(Noting that he has subsequently changed his mind. I have not. --[[User:Tryptofish|Tryptofish]] ([[User talk:Tryptofish|talk]]) 18:16, 5 July 2012 (UTC))</small> There are quite a few users whom I respect who have ended up opposing, and this RfA seems to me to contain much of what people debate, about whether or not RfA has become too difficult, so I want to explain my reasoning carefully. I've seen Ryan's editing repeatedly, and he has always been both courteous and clueful when I've interacted with him. The issues about userboxen are non-issues for me, because I've seen his editing style, and he just doesn't have editing problems in those areas. I've looked into the article that has now gone to AfD, and although it doesn't strike me as a particularly good or keep-worthy article, I'm just not seeing anything that would lead me to conclude that he would be an inept or insensitive administrator. Nor am I concerned about the parsing of the discussions here about AfD philosophy. And for that block, I've read all of the discussions that came with it, and what I see is a single dumb mistake, followed by a thoughtful learning process by someone who really wants to contribute positively. It's actually quite nice to see someone who made a mistake as a new editor, now reaching out to help new editors. We certainly have had many users who got themselves blocked, and then just said the hell with it. This is different – and you can see how it is different, by looking at how Ryan has been conducting himself in the face of criticism during this RfA. This is exactly why we should believe in second chances. --"

Just  over a year ago  he was asked to  act with  more maturity, after which  he was indef banned from  the GA process (although this was later modified). I  was concerned over his unauthorised survey only 9 months ago, followed by the issues with his blocked alternative account. Problems with his use of AWB only 5 months ago followed by an application to be part of the RfBAG group gave me concern and only  3 months ago  he gets blocked for messing  about with bot business and appears to  blame the tools for his errors.  His 50 most recent AfD !votes match the closures only 33.3% of the time, and his NAC just 24 days ago, reverted by  an admin  and closed by  another with  a different  conclusion,  was far too  complex for ''any'' NAC.  Having  !voted on  45  RfAs (matched the end result only 54.5% of the time) and reading all  the advice pages, he should have been aware that this call  for office is very  much too soon.

There's an example of off-base speedy deletion tagging at [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Greycaps_India&oldid=498187780], a desire to delete rather than prune at [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SkillPages&oldid=498481594] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ATOL_495&oldid=496422130], and a completely wrong understanding of A7 at [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Ryan_%28author%29&oldid=496453872]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cyanogen_fluoride&oldid=496060129] is a very clear example of hastiness, which I feel is an underlying trait in many of his actions, although waiting 10-30 minutes before speedy deleting may be within policy, I feel it still carries BITE-y qualities. These examples are just from one month- June. What tipped me over the edge was the unprofessional and aggressive attitude displayed by the candidate during the Mysoe exchange, seen on his talk page and pointed out by Townlake. Admins need to be professional and courteous at all times when interacting with other editors- this is something that I cannot compromise on.--"

Bearing grudges does not become an administrator, especially when it gets to the level of weighing in (repeatedly, and with strong views) on an ANI thread tangentially related to an argument from some six months previous. This and the two discussions themselves seem to demonstrate a degree of bloody-mindedness on the part of the candidate, which is a trait we need in ''fewer'' admin, not more. They also speak poorly of the candidate's ability to deal with editors who disagree with him, which, if those two discussions are anything to go by, seems to consist of throwing a tantrum and starting a row which takes up a ridiculous amount of space. Finally, the sneakiness and disingenuousness of [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ontario_Highway_401&diff=480078361&oldid=480074857 this edit] (in which the candidate removed two sets of coordinates after the article was promoted to FA, having added them days earlier to ensure the success of the FAC, and did so under a misleading edit summary) and participation in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ontario_Highway_401&offset=20120312020734&limit=20&action=history ensuing edit war] is just about the farthest thing from what I expect of potential admins. For the purposes of this RfA, I don't give a flying fuck about whether or not the articles should contain coordinates; what concerns me is the candidate's deceitful, sneaky and dishonest conduct throughout the whole thing, and his belligerence in holding a grudge for an extended period.

Some of the oppose concerns look reasonable, especially the Colonel's point that you're not always friendly and helpful to newbies.  Sometimes it might be better to slow down your output a little to give you more time to communicate sympathetically with the different audiences you're interacting with. Brevity is a great virtue, but it can be overdone. When talking to someone who differs sharply in worldview or relevant experience, making short concise comments can be unhelpful even if you're perfectly correct.  You need to make the effort to understand where they are coming from, and then talk in a way they'll understand. Its something you'll get better at with time.   IMO, attacking Conservapedia would be a negative for someone over 30s. As I guess you were fairly young at the time, and as there seems no risk of a repeat, I see it as a good thing, suggesting you have good drive and idealism.

The overwhelming majority of editors in the ""Oppose"" column indicate that their opposition is based on a neutrally-worded link to this RfA that Mabdul gave as his quit message in IRC. The message was unwise. But it is widely accepted that it has ''not'' had an unduly positive impact on the !voting (since few people on IRC would be unaware of an ongoing RfA anyway, & since the channels involved were sufficiently widely occupied to make the message seen by just as many potential opposers as supporters). Also, although posting the link was an error of judgement, it does not even come close to being serious enough to call into question the reliability of an editor who's widely acknowledged to be thoughtful, constructive, and calm-spirited. A significant subset of the opposers are driven by the rationale that IRC is a bad thing and therefore an Oppose helps to fight against a bad thing. IRC may or may not be a bad thing, but we should look to appoint administrators whose adminship benefits Wikipedia without being a risk to Wikipedia. The IRC storm-in-a-teacup does not change the fact Mabdul has met those criteria, and the closing bureaucrat should look dimly on shallow Oppose rationales such as ""canvassing"" and ""per Logan"". RfA does not exist as a means to indicate disapproval of IRC. --"

I would recommend avoiding entirely subjects or editors where [[WP:stalk]] has come into play. Avoid people who aggravate. This is a big project. The only way we can all get along is to work on getting along-- and avoiding those with whom we cannot. The best way to avoid an accusation of impropriety is to avoid the appearance thereof.

I started out thinking I would support, but then wrote out a Neutral response due to HJ Mitchell's concerns, and after a great deal of digging into past ANI, talk, etc, I find myself here.  My criteria, the most important thing that matters to me, is the demeanor of the candidate.  Period.  Everything else can be learned, so past minor mistakes don't bother me, but we seldom change our stripes, our style of communication.  While Floydian's style makes him a formidable editor in a debate, I fear it would be problematic when dealing with the vast array of problems forced upon him if he had the admin bit.  An admin that is too gruff, rigid or blunt at times can cost us good editors, something I'm already having to spend time dealing with.  Looking at the totality of edits, rather than any singular examples, I find an overall good editor, but not a good admin.  In short, I fear it would not be a [[WP:Net positive]] for Wikipedia."

Clear and detailed communication, not evasion and redirection, are what we should expect from administrators. I'm singularly unimpressed by the answer to my question 11, where the candidate apparently thinks that any debate without an immediately obvious outcome is a no consensus, and no mention whatsoever is made in the answer of carefully reading the discussion and evaluating the arguments, checking for [[WP:SPA|single purpose accounts]], or any other normal process when closing a discussion. Also, question 8 (asking the candidate about content disputes) refers the reader back to question 7, but question 7 has nothing in its answer about content disputes, just content ''writing''.

As feedback to the candidate, I'd like to see more robust answers to a editor query or advice on taking corrective action than simply the quoting of a WP guideline or help page.

I would strongly encourage this editor to re-nominate in no little than 6-12 months - by then, they would have not only accumulated more edits - rather more ''knowledge'', and would have a better understanding of their surroundings on the project. Finally, Theopolisme, I urge you to take these comments made here, as constructive criticism - because at the end of the day, you may not make a great administrator (presently), but you are certainly made out to be a wonderful editor.

When there is a dispute, you will often see admins arguing vociferously - if you see them agreeing and supporting one another, it is because ''they agree''. And they often agree because of the simple fact that they, as experienced admins, understand policy and editor behavior patterns better than the average user.

It is admirable that he wants to work in such a difficult area (US Supreme Court decisions) but I don't think his contributions (in that particular article - I haven't looked at other contribs) were of particularly high quality. I don't agree with what another editor said, that he has an ""obvious grasp of legal concepts."" It also concerns me that after I made the strong opposing comments he pretty much abandoned the FAC.  He engaged in a little bit of discussion - but not much and most of the problems I identified with the article are still there.

Ok, I had to go and do a little real digging, and then stopped as I began to just remember many things as I read more from others. Yes, the Userpage deletion bothers me for someone wishing to be an admin. I do it myself once in a while but go back and archive it when I have time manually (still have some to finish up). NA does not even do this, and at this point it may be a duanting task to accomplish. TP brought up canvassing and I do remember now that is indeed how I first encountered NA last year when OWS became a sticky wicket for Drmies on the Admin board. I also have concerns with deletion. As some OWS articles should be merged and or deleted as part of a clean-up effort I began for the Occupy articles. This became an issue with them and I decided to back away instead of arguing. I think North is a decent editor, I do...but I also know he has some issues. The copyright issue is big, the blanking of the user page is unreasonable for an admin hopeful and the canvassing issue I have first hand experiance with this editor. I am concerned with the amount of AFD votes for keep as this has been an issue I also have seen first hand and with articles. The rescue squadron issue for me, always seemed to be a matter of bias. With OWS he seemed to want to keep all articles regardless of the promotional or copyright issues. I am also concerned about the use of another account brought up in comments.

Per the sentiments of ϢereSpielChequers, and DGG (who actually took my unintentionally took some of my argument), I have to oppose. A lot of our articles contain unsourced content. The fact that we allow for it to exist is because we assume that someday some editor will come along and magically source the content, or the information being there is something which will help the average Joe discover something about something, and make a great discovery as a result (okay, maybe not this far, but I hope my point is being made). Some of the many edits that are made here add some very valuable material, for which there is literally no source that is acceptable, because it could be an oral history that is backed up by photographs, but not a book. I really feel uneasy about giving you the tools only because you have indicated that you might be more inclined to delete unsourced material than others, but that does not mean that I find fault in the rest of you.

I agree with my fellow editors above that prior to this RfA we have not seen enough A-category CSD tags to really get a good sense of your understanding of the criteria. In one of your responses above, you noted the importance of following WP:BEFORE in any deletion work. Then, declaring you were heading into New Page Patrolling, you went ahead and tagged [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Siliana_Gaspard&diff=494936232&oldid=494845536 this] (which I believe did not follow WP:BEFORE for at least two reasons), and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rockstar_Consortium_Inc.&diff=494963178&oldid=494901995 this], at a time when your contributions are under the most scrutiny, so that's not especially reassuring. Your AfD contributions also raise some red flags for me. I'm all for concise communication when appropriate, but your rationales are so brief that we do not get an understanding of your thinking process or if you have done any research prior to making a !vote or nomination. Nominations like [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gotta Lotta Love|this]] and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Blasts in Nairobi|this]] appear to be typical of your AfD work, where you cite a policy or guideline without explaining the reasons the article violates them, and not actually saying if you have searched for sources when you declare that something has ""no indication of notability"" (which is a quote from your Prod work, which is similar). Even if you have searched for sources, I think it's important to be explicit about what you have done, in order to set an example to new contributors to deletion discussions, and also to reassure non-Wikipedians that we are not just making deletion decisions on a whim. Too many of your contributions become [[Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions|Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions]] due to their brevity. [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Fair trade coffee]] is particularly concerning to me. Did you look at the article history? Why have you not revisited the discussion? When you do not revisit AfD discussions when new information comes to light, it gives the impression of drive-by voting. ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Greg Long]] is another example.) Sorry for the long rationale here, but I think it's needed in order to explain how i came to an overall impression. Any of the single things I mentioned above, taken in isolation, would certainly be unfair nitpicking, but as a whole it paints a concerning picture about your approach to deletions—to me at least. <font face=""Comic sans MS"">"

It was good that the candidate pointed it out, but the emphasized part that further (good-faith) edits would be considered vandalism troubled me as both misunderstanding the definition and intimidation. Both issues seemed redeemable (candidate would ""tread lightly"" at AIV), so I asked Q6. The answer is not satisfactory. The answer skipped the general definition, it didn't catch the threat part, and it reiterated details. The candidate either did not research the definition of vandalism before answering or did not understand the definition. Admins should do both. The implication that the editor made ""a claim that is known to be incorrect"" is troubling in light of the claim was later shown to be correct. (Google(Joe Martinez resident Barstow).) There are technical distinctions about the intention of the editor that are missed. The candidate should be getting a lot more out the incident.

However, this editor has in the past objected to RfAs where experience didn't match desired admin areas; by his own petard he must be hoisted.  Editors in past RfAs have rejected applicants due to lack of content work, yet this editor has created four-ish non-stub articles, and none are GA or FA; there was no mention of DYK work.  The lack of substantial content work is of no major concern to me; being an administrator is about administrating, but others might complain that this is an encyclopedia first, and a bureaucracy (close) second.

For example ""Kafka was rapidly promoted and his duties included processing and investigating compensation claims, writing reports, and handling appeals from businessmen who felt their firm had been placed in too high a risk category; which cost them more in insurance premiums.{{sfn|Stach|2005|pp=26-30}}  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Franz_Kafka&diff=516509058&oldid=prev].

As I read it, Kafka's job was to asess workplace safety arrangements.  There is a para about him addressing a group of industry representatives, but this does not refer to 'risk category'.  Moreover, it was the job of the mathematicians in the department to assign a 'risk category', and so on.

Reaper Eternal,Mabdul,1,-1,2012,"12:34, 28 March 2012","'''Support''' - The IRC message, while probably not wholly thought out, is really not much more canvassing than adding the ""I'm undergoing an RFA!"" banner to your userpage.

Fluffernutter,SarahStierch,1,1,2012,"00:39, 21 July 2012","'''Support'''. Everything I've seen of Sarah has all added up to tell me that she'll be a solid addition to our corps of admins. Smart, helpful, and expends more energy in one day to work for the good of the project and the movement than most of us have mustered in the past week. My one concern is that Sarah's sometimes-forceful personality might get her into some clashes, but there's also plenty of evidence through her work in places like the Teahouse (and her answer to Q3) that she recognizes that everyone can't know everything and that there's value to be found in consulting other people or having a cup of tea before acting or speaking in a contentious situation. So there's my advice to you, Sarah: when this RFA passes, as I hope it will, don't forget that you don't have to do everything that needs doing, and don't forget to make use of the brains (mmm, braiiiins...) of your fellow editors when you hit something new.<p>P.S. Curiosity drives me to ask - have we ever had a WMF fellow run for adminship during the period of their fellowship before?

Certainly I do disagree with some of his positions pertaining to sourcing and [[WP:BLP|our coverage of biographical articles]], but simply holding radically different views than the norm is not enough in itself to convince me that somebody would abuse the sysop bit for the purposes of advancing their position. [[User:Dominic|Dominic's]] oppose is not concerning to me, for the same reason as I've outlined already with regards to sourcing and BLPs; however, there is the added caveat that it ''does'' show a willingness on Gigs's part to ''stir the pot'' a bit, which I have no problem with so long as it's not taken to such an extreme that it belittles the opinions of others. I am reasonably convinced that it does not, and so this is a non-issue insofar as it pertains to this user's suitability for adminship. The only oppose rationale that actually holds any water for me is that of [[User:Dennis Brown|Dennis Brown]], who I think shares the same gut reaction that I myself had gotten while reading his answers to the questions. Admittedly, something rubs me the wrong way. I don't think Gigs intended for anything he said to come across as ''pretentious'', nor do I think he is even in possession of an inflated ego by any stretch of the imagination, but comments such as ""I already am [an administrator], really"" or "" I am happy to entertain any number of questions at this RfA...but I reserve the right to not answer them"" do give me pause as to whether or not he can adequately assess the perception that his words might give off to others.

Q1 starts out fine (work at UAA and AIV; has 105 edits to UAA and 47 edits to AIV; later edit filters), but then gets a small bit unfocused (help where can). I like the reserved stance. Tenure is fine. Edit count has 1100 article space edits that stuck, and that raises a concern about editing experience. The article space edit distribution is skewed from what I expect -- 14 percent article + 4 percent talk. (CSD edits would be multiplied by 3: 1 for article tag, one for user talk, and one for CSD log; successful CSD tag would delete article edit.) I don't have hard limits for edit counts, but edit counts can suggest issues. Article space tags require reading and understanding the article, but good CSD tags would not give rise to much debate. That explains Q3 revealing no significant conflict. I want to see admins have significant conflict and be on both sides: stepping and stepped. I want to see balance and exposure. High article edits also imply exposure to consensus building in difficult situations. CSD tagging skills are fine. AfD main diagonal shows accuracy, but keep votes nearly absent (the confusion matrix has errors). Not only is the candidate weak on content creation, but also primary effort is deletion (many AfD noms). Candidate is missing some valuable perspective. At [[User talk:Writ Keeper/Archives/1#Firearm Cartridges]], WK minimizes newbie Fundamental Motivation's complaint about WK's [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cartridge_(firearms)&diff=480877552&oldid=480876636 10K character revert] as ""you spent just above one hour on this, not many"". See also [[User talk:Fundamental Motivation]]. WK reverted FM's first eight edits ever; FM rallied to fix problems over the next few days, but FM stopped editing within a month. There were problems with FM's edits, but I wonder if a content editor might be a little more sensitive. WK's answer to my Q14 was fine; GNG is the issue for elementary schools. WK will be a fine admin, but I want to see broader exposure/experience. Content work has significant benefits."

Otherwise we could wind up with an admin who'd delete unsourced articles on notable topics without even a cursory attempt to source them - we allow this on BLPs but BLPprod is an exception.  I'm not seeing any use of reliable sources in the nomination statement or questions, and whilst I haven't checked all of the candidate's contributions, I have looked at the articles they've listed at [[User:SwisterTwister#Content_I've_added]].

The avoidance of conflict, as previously noted, makes it impossible to know what he would be like as an admin. He says he wants to work at CSD, but as he doesn't keep a CSD Log, there's no way of knowing what we could expect from him there. His answers to the questions are truly sad; he never fully answered my question (#6), and the answer to #8 is just plain worthless.

I don't insist on seeing masses of content work before I support a candidate, but what I do want to see is content-related interaction and I want to be able to judge a candidate's interaction skills in content-related areas. I fully expected to be able to find plenty of examples, but I was surprised that I really couldn't - I'd expect an admin candidate's Talk page to be full of content-related discussion, but as others have pointed out, it isn't. After looking quite hard, I found very little content work, I haven't really found much content-related discussion, and I haven't found enough personal interaction to really have any idea how the candidate would handle disputes. Sure, it might all be on IRC, but given that that's all out of sight to me, it might as well be on Mars. I'm not saying I think Avicennasis will make a bad admin - not at all. Avicennasis might make a great admin - but I just can't tell.

Helpful, trustworthy, and diligently committed to the project, Yngvadottir is an editor who simply is more used to communicating informally than push a serious image to the people around. The fantastic part is the honesty involved in her communication and actions. Especially within an RfA, unfortunately, this may give off a flippant image - which clearly is neither her intention nor what must be construed. I can imagine her using her now trademarked OMGs and smileys with newbies and can vouch that perhaps that may be more effective in creating a sparkling and welcoming dialogue for new editors than do some of our inveterate welcome/warning tags. There is of course the question of the opposes below. In summary, these widely touch the following areas: her RfA answers are non-serious (too short/too long/too delayed/informal), she has once left a partly negative statement of her view on administration, her talk page is not archived, she took long to sign the RfA and that her experience is lacking in admin-related areas. Leave the last reasoning (which is a credible and perfectly competent reason the community holds), the other reasons provided in the opposes can be improved by the editor in perhaps just a day. Yngvadottir has also already committed to initially not close discussions where consensus has to be fathomed. Given all that, I'm sure the closing bureaucrat would consider it proper to convey a guiding advice to the editor while closing this RfA, which I do expect to be closed as successful. It'll be good to have Yngvadottir with us handling administration."

Indeed, his edits seem a great benefit to the project, and he shows a great amount of clue in his main editing activities.

If this was done at an RFA, it would be called badgering by many. Knowing when to back off during a discussion can be just as important as knowing when to speak up, as it can prevent further tension, and I don't believe that Bagumba has found an ideal balance.

Your contributions to mainspace are generally very good and noteworthy.  You are thoughtful, mature, and I believe you put the interests of Wikipedia above your own.  What I don't see, however, is working in contentious areas.  An admin must be able to deal with others who are out of control, without losing his cool and simply blocking everyone.  He has to be able to provide balance and neutrality in discussions at AFD, or just when questioned about his actions.  Even if you only work at AFD, you have to be able to draw the line between ""spirited debate"" ""moderate incivility"" and ""personal attack"", and know when to warn someone in the discussion, on their talk page, or take action.  This takes practice.  I think you should work a little at [[WP:DRN]] or [[WP:3RR]] and learn the basics, slowly at first.  This will help you hone your communications skills when dealing with others in less than ideal situations.  You don't have to be an expert in this area, but you need enough experience so that when a situation gets out of hand, you can be comfortable and confident in taking control and seeking resolution.

However, I get the impression that you are more than a little hot-headed, and I suspect this is what has led to much of the controversy. You have what you think are good ideas, and like everyone's brilliant ideas, some are brilliant and other are total bollocks. The problems arise when you try to implement these brilliant ideas, especially the ones that are (or which other people think are) total bollocks and you encounter resistance. With the greatest respect, I don't think you handle criticism or questions of your actions very well (which is perhaps unfair to say here, because you can't respond to it without appearing to prove my point, so I apologise), and you, perhaps inadvertently, escalate the situation. This leads to things like the socking, and the so-called ""ragequitting"" and to many of the other issues that have got you into trouble. I could support a candidate with that in his history (although with you it's rather too recent history right now), if that underlying hot-headeness had been resolved, but it isn't something that's going to go away overnight. Thus, it's with regret that I have to say that you're not suited to adminship, at least not for the foreseeable future. However, I am familiar with your work at MILHIST, and I have always respected you for that, and I hope you'll continue the good work you do after this RfA."

In most RfAs, we are left with nothing but an editorial track record to gauge someone's suitability for the role of an administrator, but here we have the unusual benefit of already knowing whether or not promoting this user will be a net positive for the site. History bodes strongly in PumpkinSky/Rlevse's favour. He was an absolutely ''superlative'' administrator, and I am of the opinion that he should once again serve as a sysop. The close paraphrasing thing was a misunderstanding on his part (and a pretty common one at that), but he handled it quite well when all is considered. I haven't yet looked at the opposes, but my guess is that they're generally of the opinion that Rlevse has abused the trust of the community by socking around the issues with his prior account in attempting to have a clean start under a new username, and I understand their concerns, but I still don't feel as if anything he's done has reached the level where we should no longer have confidence in his abilities and his dedication to the project.

True, in his response to question 11 he was calm and respectful, but I'm sure he realized that this was a deliberately provocative question designed to see how he would react - similar to a stress interview. An administrator needs to demonstrate a ""judicial temperament"": the ability to remain calm and uninvolved, to avoid hyperbole and blanket statements, to accept and enforce the rules of the system as given. Based on his contributions as recently as a month or two ago (see question 4), I don't think he has that temperament at this point. (For that matter, I am troubled by that nomination itself, which made less than an hour after the article's creation, and was based on an incorrect belief that the school in question was a primary school, so that he clearly did not follow [[WP:BEFORE]].)

I was looking for evidence that they have used escalating vandalism messages in an appropriate way, referred cases to [[WP:RPP]] correctly and reported accurately formatted cases for Admin action at [[WP:AIV]]. As far as I can see the candidate has done no such work. If the candidate has no experience he is unsuitable at this stage. Although the downside risk might be low, I see no reason to risk pages being protected (or not) and editors being blocked (or not) because the candidate does not have sufficient grasp of relevant policy. They have no experience gained through performing a few simple but important janitorial tasks during the many years they have been here and especially in the period prior to RFA. A request for tools in an area where they can demonstrate no aptitude makes no sense.

The closing rationale was long-winded, and overstated GNG's impact, which was only specifically mentioned once by participants. Response to Oppose #9 of ""I'm initially leery of immediately changing..."" followed by ""Please provide suggestions on my User talk page about improvements"" seems disingenuous when suggestions were already given.

You have taken almost no part in discussions of any sort. You have made all of one talk page post (plus a second edit to add your signature) since August 2011. How can someone who virtually never interacts with other users be an administrator? However, we do now finally have an indication of how you may be expected to participate in discussions, as you have made several posts to this page, and we see a negative and unconstructive approach to other editors.

Sigma is clearly an intelligent, capable, technically-savvy editor. I also think xe is honest. However, Sigma has behaved poorly in too many incidents. Sigma is to be commended for their candor in owning up (mostly) to past errors, but the time period in which xe has been editing is too compressed for me to have confidence that xe's reformed. Also, the problems are not related to misunderstood or misapplied policies or guidelines. That's just knowledge; it can be acquired and fixed. Temperament is not something so easily learned.<br>Two contentious areas that have been discussed here. First, the user name. Frankly, I don't understand the level of hostility toward Sigma's user name. Sure, it may be mildly irritating, but it shouldn't be enough to oppose. That said, I also don't understand why Sigma was so reluctant to accommodate the complainers. Even now, I don't completely understand what Sigma has done to ""correct"" the problem, but Sigma's reaction was a bit grudging and I-shouldn’t-have-to. Second, the Conservapedia issue. I agree with TP that we shouldn't go on a witch hunt about off-wiki behavior, but Sigma used a Wikipedia channel. These channels are not official, but they are related to Wikipedia and attract Wikipedians. If Sigma had used some other forum, I would feel differently, but I don't approve of vandalizing websites, no matter how much you disagree with what they stand for. And I didn't appreciate Sigma's quibble on what constitutes vandalism. Just to be clear, I am not opposing just because of these two problems, but because of these ''and'' the other problems highlighted by editors, some of which have been admitted by Sigma .<br>I'll close by saying that I have an enormous amount of respect for many of Sigma's supporters, and I was very tempted not to vote, but I felt it would be cowardly of me to stand in the wings. It looks likely to me that Sigma will be nominated. If so, I wish them nothing but the best. Sometimes, the acquisition of administrative responsibility gives a person a new perspective. Hopefully, Sigma will pause before acting and deliberate more about what xe does.--"

We need lots of different kinds of people to be admins. I like her question answers too. At this stage in the game the answers to the typical questions are almost ""canned"" in a sense, we've all seen it before. I find her relaxed, honest answers quite refreshing. The candidate knows the policies of the areas she works in, she's certainly not a drama magnet, clean record, hard working so why not?"

Pol430,Yngvadottir,-1,1,2012,"16:41, 2 April 2012","'''Oppose''' Sorry. I applaud the candidate's content creation and wholeheartedly endorse the viewpoint that they are an asset to Wikipedia. I am slightly concerned about their apparent lack of experience in the core admin areas (AIV, RPP, XfD etc.), though I may have been prepared to overlook this, due to the candidates stated desire to mostly use the mop for DYK work. What is more concerning to me, is the lack of response to the additional questions asked by Beeblebrox and Jc37. Whilst I appreciate that the questions are 'optional' the apparent lack of interest in answering them strikes me as somewhat disingenuous. The candidate has had plenty of time to answer those questions and has responded to other points at this RfA since then. I am also concerned about the response to Starblind, when the candidate said: ""In any case, there will always be ambitious and authoritarian people around. In a project of this size and scope, I'd better be able to deal with 'em, though I don't understand 'em."". Deal with them how?"
