I've only run across RockMagnetist once in my travels in checking/editing articles on this Wikipedia, and RockMagnetist seems like a good candidate for this based on the description above. However, since I have to base my votes on the actual experience I have had with the user as an editor, I cannot sway my vote either way. Either way, I am leaning more towards a support, but since I vote based on interaction, I have neither any positive nor negative thoughts going through my head, so I vote \"Neutral\".\n",

      "\n",
      "'''Oppose'''. Well, I was going to vote \"Neutral\" since I base my votes on interaction with the editor/user; however, after reading [[User:Reaper Eternal|Reaper Eternal]]'s opposition statement, I can definitely agree that I do not want an administrator who possesses such qualities. Wikipedia is not an MMORPG; if one wants to play an MMORPG, subscribe to one and play it. I'd rather there not be a risk of the integrity of Wikipedia being disrupted by a administrator who wants who has a risk of using the tools for the wrong purposes.\n",

      "\n",
      "'''Moral support''' You look to be a prolific and valuable editor, so I hope you won't be discouraged by the oppose votes, whatever the outcome. But some of them have raised some good points about temperament. A \"dirty\" block log shouldn't [[Wikipedia:Mark of Cain|permanently disqualify]] you or anything, but recent edit warring suggests you haven't left those habits behind. Keep clean and I'll hope to give you full support next time. --\n",

      "'''Oppose''' Sorry. You've undoubtedly made some very positive contributions to the project, but there's no way I could support ''anyone'' at RfA less than a month after a block. Be on your best behavior for as long as possible, and hopefully all of us can put this nastiness behind us someday. --\n",
      "\n",
      "'''Weak support''' Piotrus's positive contributions to the project are tremendous, and the EEML business is far enough in the past that I believe he has learned from his mistakes. I was very put off by his combative responses to some editors on this page, such that I wasn't sure he had the demeanor of a good administrator. It looks like he's cooled down, but presumably anyone can wear a smiley mask for a few days at RfA. Keep a cool head and try again in a few months. --\n",
