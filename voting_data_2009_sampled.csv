When I saw how many opposes this RFA was getting, I assumed ChildofMidnight must be some kind of vandal or tendentious editor; but having taken a look at his edits, that doesn't seem to be the case. What I see is a user who has good intentions and does genuinely want to improve Wikipedia, but keeps getting into disputes and isn't very good at resolving them. Those disputes - for example, the edit-warring at [[Barney Frank]] - are enough to stop me from supporting this time. However, I recognise that ChildofMidnight has apologised for his past mistakes, and seems to be making improvements already - as shown, I think, by his answers to the questions. My advice to him would be: don't get too put off by the level of opposition here, but understand that you don't need to be an admin to be an effective contributor to Wikipedia. Moreover, not everyone who might make a good admin passes RFA. Basically, I think ChildofMidnight has a low chance of passing RFA, based on his previous behaviour; but that shouldn't stop him trying to be a good editor. What's important is not who has the tools, but who ''acts'' like an admin, in a calm, reasonable and collaborative manner. If you keep up to admin levels of behaviour, then people will admire and respect you accordingly; and who knows, maybe you'll eventually pass RFA after all.

His answer to Spartacus' question (7) explains everything quite clearly. The fact that he doesn't agree with this AfD policy does not in ''any way'' suggest that he would mess up AfDs, abuse the tools, break the project, or otherwise be a bad admin. The man is entitled to his own opinion, isn't he? His past contributions look fine, not to say impressive, and he's been around for years. Opposing just because of his ""wikitically incorrect"" answer to question 5 smells of short-sighted GroupThink, if you don't mind me saying so.

While I see no major issues in any area, Fribbler's relative inactivity is bothersome.  Additionally, the answers to the questions were accurate but failed to demonstrate an understanding of why policy is the way it is. I don't doubt his intelligence, nor has he made any serious errors in the past.  However, the culture and expectations of Wikipedia change over time and I don't see someone of his activity level being aware of the changing cultural standards.  That relative inactivity combined with a desire to work in speedy deletion causes me to oppose.  Practically speaking, there are nearly no checks and balances on an admin's speedy deletions.  A bad speedy can scare away a potential contributor and it just isn't worth the risk giving that ability to someone who has so little use of the tools anyway.

Nick,Until It Sleeps,-1,-1,2009,"22:53, 20 August 2009","'''Oppose''' - The lack of collaboration, the lack of experience in editing without tools and the attitude shown by the user here simply makes it undesireable for this user to be given access to the administrator toolset. Using various buttons and programs to remove vandalism is fine, but it's rare for administrators to do nothing but revert and block vandals, eventually pretty much every administrator will have to deal with a content dispute or some other issue, even if it's only brought to their attention when they're doing vandalism patrol, and without well rounded experience here on Wikipedia, they're either going to get involved and are quite likely to make an error that causes further complications (blocking at the wrong time, not blocking at the right time etc) or they'll ignore what they've seen and carry on their merry way. Ignoring stuff (especially if there's no communication to other admnistrators, and with a lack of evidence of good communication in the case of UIS) is bad, making bad decisions far worse, but both options are undesireable, and on the evidence presented here, I'm worried that either option is a serious possibility."

The first thing I noticed about the candidate was that his talk page goes back a year and a half, a sign of little communication with other editors. (Actually, the first thing I noticed was that he knows C++, as per his userpage, but that was pretty irrelevant). I was also put off because of his lack of communication [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CRGreathouse&diff=prev&oldid=226308996 here], when a new editor of only a month and a half came to him with a legitimate question regarding a particular individual's behavior and its relation to policy. CRGreathouse did not attempt to answer the question, give the new editor a policy link, or even point him to someone who he thought could help, instead responding, ""I'm not an admin"", which was completely unhelpful. Now, obviously that diff is from six months ago, but it was within the candidate's last 50 User Talk edits. Next, CRGreathouse's last 500 edits go back over five months, so that makes me question whether he remains all that current on the goings-on here on Wikipedia. Of course, I'm aware of real-life, but having so few recent edits gives me the feeling that maybe he's a little ""rusty"". I was also not a fan of his edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CRGreathouse&diff=262017055&oldid=261167982 here], where he said, ""I shouldn't have to do it [RFA] more than once."" To me, that came off extremely cocky. Also, looking through his project space contribs, I see that he works nearly exclusively in AFD (now don't get me wrong, his work there looks good), so I'd be comfortable with him working there, but he doesn't mention it in Q1, unless that was included by ""many parts of page management"", but he instead speaks of CSD, an area in which he appears to have little experience.

We need administrators who are willing to state that they are comfortable taking a non-partisan, non-biased view in closing debates, whether it is for deletion or keep. In relation, I'm not comfortable with an administrator who doesn't want to take the time to look up basic BLP and AFD procedure. If it is ""no consensus,"" then a BLP is defaulted to keep but in the most extreme of cases.

In these sorts of situations in the future, I suggest making a separate effort to talk to both users in depth (via e-mail or talk page), explaining the proper use of edit summaries, the conflict of interest policy, avoiding edit wars, and the like. One additional piece of advice is to consider making some sort of statement on the ANI thread to users A,B, and C, explaining why you're ignoring their suggestions.

Ucucha,Shubinator,1,1,2009,"16:46, 24 December 2009","'''Support''' Shubinator's contributions to DYK have been valuable and knowledgeable (as Materialscientist noted). His DYKcheck tool is a very valuable tool that has saved me and others a lot of time. To me, this shows a good admin's attitude—he sees where he can help and does it. In fact, I'll have to enter the cliche that I actually thought you were already an admin—and a good one at that.<p>I don't completely agree with your way of handling BLPs, but your answers appear to be within the bounds of admin discretion supported in recent precedents. Opposing over differences in opinion, or in interpretation of policy (where the interpretation is reasonable) is unproductive, but I feel that this is what Seraphimblade is doing in his oppose. (Also, I think Seraphimblade should consider Shubinator's answer to Q7.)<p>RMHED's oppose is baseless without any supporting evidence. I haven't seen any reason not to trust Shubinator, but would urge any user who has evidence to the contrary to come forth with it instead of just asserting it.<p>I don't see the fault in the Q4 response that Doc Quintana and Smithers7 see. Shubinator is right that a cooldown block in itself is not acceptable, but that in cases where one would consider a cooldown block, a block for vandalism or general disruptiveness may often be appropriate anyway. Shubinator's answers are all succinct and to the point—an additional argument in favor of granting him adminship.<p>The concern expressed by Hobit and Friday doesn't seem well-founded. True, Shubinator showed a pretty good understanding of wikisyntax in his earliest few edits, but that's understandable for someone who has done some IP edits before and who has taken the time to get a bit familiar with the syntax. Note that his first edit was not as flawless as one would expect from a returning user, as shown by his use of third-level headers and bare-URL references.<p>In summary, Shubinator is a valued contributor who will undoubtedly also be a valued admin and the comments under ""Oppose"" and ""Neutral"" lack solid ground. I'll take this opportunity to correct the bad Latin introduced by one of the users who were so kind to support my RFA and say: ''Tribue virgam!''"

This is completely against the nature of RfA being a discussion (whether it is or not is irrelevant, it should be, and this goes against that ideal). As for the comment that ""Download doesn't plan on working in AFD yet"", adminship does not come in parts, it comes as one complete package. Once you have it you can (and I'm not saying that you will) disregard absolutely anything that has been said here, and work at whichever administrative areas that you wish to work at. This, of course, includes AfD, and whilst I am willing to believe that if the candidate says that they will not work at AfD until they are ready that they will not work there until they ''believe'' that they are ready, the very nature of this request for adminship gives me a slight concern about that judgment, and I'd like for Download to be reassessed at that point. [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Seven ways to greet a neighbor]] also brings some concern, as it seems to indicate that Download does not, at this point in time, understand core policies pertaining to copyright violations (and what one is, it would appear) and notability. I would also like to know what makes you feel more 'ready for adminship' now than a month ago, when you [[User_talk:Download/Archives/2009/April#Adminship|told GT5162]] that you wanted to perform more non-admin work and that you wanted to gain more experience prior to going through the RfA process.

Three months isn't that long; I've been around for two years, and it seems like I've just begun! There are quite literally thousands of policies, guidelines, essays, how-to guides, noticeboards and discussion pages, and to be perfectly honest, I don't feel three months is enough time to become familiar with them and all their associated [[WP:TLA]]'s. As an administrator, you'll receive countless questions ranging from ""Why did you delete my article?"" to ""Do you know how to report a potential copyright violation"", so you'll need to know where to point people. I don't expect you (or anyone else) to memorize all policies; in fact, I encourage people to read them slowly and over a long period of time. But as I said, three months is simply not enough time to become familiar with all major aspects of the community. However, you seem capable of learning on the job, and that's what is keeping me from opposing.

So, in a nutshell, I dislike the way you interacted with Download, I think your policy knowledge is off - it would have to be to think that templated warnings were personal attacks, and I need more time to see that you are not still in that 'phase', if you like. To be fair, it just seems like the whole thing between you and Download is a bit over the top and full of assumptions of bad faith, which is something which I would certainly not like to see from a prospective administrator.

However, one more than one occasion, I've been talking to Neuro in a channel, and before we finish the conversation, he makes a comment, and leaves before I have the chance to reply. I don't like the idea of having an administrator that walks away from issues, instead of trying to handle them. Besides this, I've read [[User:Neurolysis/Apology]] again before considering my !vote here, and I'm not exactly impressed by it. I don't like that he left his account because he couldn't handle the criticism. That shows immaturity, IMO. After he came back on his new account, I would at least expect him to come right out and say ""This is me, I've created a new account."" Instead though, it seems he only announced it because many were getting suspicious. Neurolysis is generally a great help to the community, and we do get along very often, but I'm not comfortable placing the tools in his hands.

I can't support an admin who would consider themself quietly above the rules (though I like [[WP:ROUGE]] and the rest, which are all in good fun). Before this, I was watching this RfA and have been quietly dismayed by your drive-by truncations of articles without trying to add to them (e.g., [{{fullurl:Brickwork|diff=281472281}}]).

He's commenting on a Wikipedia user, by account name, with hair-raising ignorance and assumption of bad faith; he can't have spent five seconds researching the matter. Yes, his comments are published off-site; if other reviewers here prefer not to pay attention to anything off Wikipedia, that's up to them.

Ling.Nut,PeterSymonds,-1,1,2009,"15:10, 18 January 2009","'''Symbolic Oppose'''. This nom will pass with flying colors, and it's even true that the odds are reasonably high that the editor will never again repeat an error of this severity... The editor has made several protestations of remorse. But ""Sorry is as sorry does."" My question #8 is labeled Optional, and the wording is pointed and disapproving. However, I'm sitting here trying to imagine a more grievous error than this editor's, and the only things that come to mind are RL threats and harassment. If the editor in fact truly valued the community; if he were truly sorry for the damage (or potential damage) that his actions caused to the community, then no good-faith questions by the community&mdash;however uncomfortable or repetitive&mdash;would be left unanswered. I know if I had done something so severe, I would feel that every one who asks a question '''deserves''' an answer. Instead, the question has sat unanswered for 36 hours. The lack of response strikes me as the actions of someone who is showing the minimum amount of repentance  necessary to re-acquire the mop. I'm afraid  must wonder if the question  would remain unanswered if the vote tally were other than a landslide of Support. [[User:Ling.Nut|Ling.Nut]] <sup>([[User talk:Ling.Nut|talk]]&mdash;"

The candidate is here to build articles per [[User:Salavat#Contributions]] and has over 40,000 total edits.  Yes, according to his bio, he is young, but not so young to give me too much pause.  In any event, the candidate has received around a half dozen barnstars (must have impressed someone!) and has never been blocked.  In [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/House of Acorn]], which should have more correctly closed as ""no consensus"", the candidate provides an alternative suggestion to transwiki, which is reasonable, although I encourage more of an explanation why we should do something rather than just a [[WP:PERNOM]] style ""vote.""  I would, incidentally, be far more open to transwikiying as a compromise if the suggestion at [[User_talk:Jimbo_Wales#How_about_allowing_links_to_Wikia.2C_for_side_article_information.3F]] is followed.  Now in [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Elite Four members]] the merge suggestion is reasonable enough, but again the reason is essentially just a [[WP:JNN]].  With regards to [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Pokémon items (2nd nomination)]] and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Pokémon moves]] as well as [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pokémon types (3rd nomination)]], I never get why this needless adherence to the idea that a reference guide cannot be a game reference guide.  We can and should do more than traditional paper encyclopedias and so long as the contents are verifiable in published reliable sources that should be sufficient.  The argument at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Spykee Head Dude (video game)]] was sound and something I agree with, i.e. if it cannot be verified and appears to be a hoax, then indeed deletion is the correct result.  My suggestion here, however, is not to simply say ""appears to be made up,"" but to indicate where you checked for sources only to be stumped and therefore reach the conclusion that indeed it does not only appear to be made up, it appears as such because after checking for sources, none could be easily found to prove as much.  Sure, we would like to assume that such search sources took place and I believe many editors do indeed do just that, but I know from experience that some don't try to check per [[WP:BEFORE]] if indeed they don't exist.  Anyway, in these examples, I did not notice anything particularly ""dickish"" toward those with whom Salavat disagreed.  Yes, some who read these may think that back in the day, these would still be enough for me to oppose the candidate.  Perhaps, but reasonable disagreement is okay and I really want to reserve my opposes for those who has said or done something eggregious enough that at the time of my typing they should not be an admin.

I'm disappointed by Q8; if Ottava saw himself in a process, I would happily work with him, but if the only choice on the table is ""take me or leave me"", there's not a lot I can do with that.

You seem too persuadable by interpersonal things, and not reliable and account privacy-minded like an admin should be. Your general response to being blocked, at first, was not a good one. I'm glad that you've regretted the actions and moved forward with productive editing since that time, but it seemed to have taken you a while to be openly remorseful for what you did, and renounce the stupid judgement behind it.

It feels harsh to oppose someone on their fourth RFA, because it means he clearly wants a great deal to be an administrator - and quite possibly Synergy ''would'' be a net positive as one. But there are just too many concerns raised by the other opposers. Firstly, there's this comment: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/User:Daniel_Brandt/open_letter&diff=prev&oldid=272850995] That's the kind of comment (shortcut for 'X is a whiny bitch') I don't ''ever'' want to see at a deletion discussion, least of all with reference to a real person. Secondly, there's the early closes of AFDs, like these [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Gay_Fuel_(2nd_nomination)&diff=prev&oldid=247682147][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Wild_(band)_(2nd_nomination)&diff=prev&oldid=247680415]. Those decisions aren't hugely problematic in practice, but they go against the spirit of AFD - an article is supposed to have 5 days (now 7) of discussion, even if it looks like consensus has been reached sooner. Thirdly, there's the behaviour towards Giano, which wasn't exactly helpful. Fourthly, there's the SPI comments referred to above - e.g. endorsing an assessment of a user one minute after it has been made. That's worryingly hasty for someone who wants to work in that area. None of these factors ''individually'' would be enough to oppose over, but taken together they weaken my confidence in Synergy; I can't say I like the IRC cliqueyness, either (or the sudden closing and re-opening of this RFA). Despite all this, I ''do'' think Synergy could make a good administrator, and I expect he will successfully pass RFA eventually. But I don't think I can support him this time, unfortunately - sorry."

The answer to question 10 is almost entirely wrong - screencaps and non-free publicity stills are frequently preferable to poorer quality free images, both for actors in character and for the cast of a show, so there are numerous occasions where a non-free image of a living person might be used.  I'm also concerned with the answer to question 7, as he seems to have somewhat confused [[WP:V]] and [[WP:N]].  If content has no reliable sources, it does not belong in the encyclopaedia.  If there are no reliable sources that even demonstrate that there are (say) highways in Sri Lanka, then an article on the subject should not be attempted, as it could not contain any verifiable content.  If content has no reliable sources that demonstrate notability, there are circumstances already defined in the guidelines in which an article may still be appropriate (eg high schools, where it is only necessary to demonstrate that the establishment exists as a high school).  Also, I am not completely convinced of the first component of the answer to question 8.  If the account really is in bad faith and just disruptive - why has it never had even a warning.

In the many cases where the file was blue-linked, i.e. it had been created again after it was deleted, I was able to determine without difficulty what the problem had been, and what had been done to fix the problem.  In at least one instance Geni links to an external page to illustrate a copyright violation.  Geni's current contribution log shows a continuing involvement with image copyright compliance.

I agree that Peter has done more than enough to apologise, recognise his error and make amends. He has clearly been forgiven by the community.

This is, of course, only my opinion, so don't jump my rump about it. In particular, the answers to my (asked by GlassCobra) BLP questions, seem noncommittal. That to me is probably my biggest concern. We need help in the area of BLP, not editors who are sort of indifferent about the whole thing. However, minors are not the best to be handing such sensitive matters anyway. The more time I spend as an admin, the more I realize just how many unseemly things come across my screen, and there is much I don't think Jamie would do well to handle. As others have justifiably pointed out, Jamie is young. Requests for examples of extraordinary maturity have been met with arguments, not diffs. Unfortunately, we can't assume all teenagers here are AnonymousDissidents. There has been too many examples of problematic admins with poor histories (in this RFA even) who make it obvious that caution is necessary when promoting young admins. Do I think Jamie would have the sort of meltdown that we've seen in some others? Not at all, but I don't feel that adminship would benefit Jamie. Net positive? Maybe for the project, but I think Jamie would be better off as an editor, not an admin.

The secret pages deletions were serious enough that, before MzMcbride resigned, ArbCom had effectively already decided to take his tools away whether he liked it or not. I feel the same sort of way as they do; that this was a massive, ''massive'' lapse of judgement. The disdain he showed to other users, the refusal to deal with the issue when it came up (instead prefering to simply ''continue'' deleting pages), the [[Santer Commission|Santer-esque]] resignation (jumping before he was pushed, essentially) are not conductive to a good editing environment and do not show an administrator with the necessary judgement, imo, to continue or be renewed. He ''was'' a good administrator, and he might ''well be'' at some point in the future. But his conduct over the past few weeks/months is such that at the ''moment'' he would be godawful. Past good conduct is not an excuse for current misconduct. If you've changed and accept you were wrong, fine; come back when we've got evidence of that in the form of diffs.

In my opinion, it is not the number of edits that counts for a user, but rather the quality of the edits. If almost all of your edits are automated, it is very difficult for me to assess your policy knowledge, and how you will handle situations as an administrator, and I have to resort to other outlets to find this information. One of the methods is looking at your answers to the questions, some of which are concerning. For example, in Q9.1, you said that you would discuss the situation with the user. Per the [[WP:U|username policy]], this is clearly the wrong approach to take. The user should be softblocked for having a promotional username (most likely with {{tl|uw-ublock}}), and the page deleted under [[WP:CSD#G11|CSD G11]].

You're probably expecting this, but the numerous RfAs isn't a good sign either IMO; his seemingly pushy attitude toward gaining adminship has always left me very uncomfortable with granting TPH the extra bit.

The editor is not a fireball with 3000 edits per month... more like 40 to 150 most months (595 one month, 420 another).  I don't see this as a disadvantage.  I read the Opposes and I despair.  Most of us who are going to fall in love with Wikipedia already have.  We need to stop <s>looking for</s> insisting on those(they are magnificent... but how many are there, really?), and start looking for the over-the-long-haul admins who are going to chug along for the next 20 years or so.

Burnte,FlyingToaster,1,-1,2009,"18:51, 21 February 2009","'''Full Support''' SoWhy raised completely valid points. However I think the most important thing he said was ""'I left out most of those where she realized her mistake.'"" Far too often we tend to look for perfection in those we wish to entrust power. Everyone is human and everyone will make mistakes. I find it far more reassuring to find someone who can admit to and learn from their mistakes than someone who never makes any. I've spoken with FT at length outside of WP about many trivial and non-trivial topics, and I find her to be a very thoughtful, conscientious, and well reasoned person who carefully and appropriately contemplates the consequences of her actions. While some of her tags in the past ''may'' have been misplaced, tagging is not a permanent action, and I don't think for a moment she would have acted on any of them without first reviewing the article and the reasoning behind it's existence and potential deletion. I also find she is eager to search out the advice and knowledge of those around her, and that she values the experiences of others as learning tools to help her make the right choices. I have no reason to believe that as an admin she would suddenly change that course and not reach out for other opinions. Like any promotion, you can't know for certain how a person will act once they have new powers and responsibilities. Only time will tell if she turns out to be a good admin, but I'm more than willing to take that risk, and support her nomination, for whatever that's worth."

I came to the impression that some reverts by this editor are retaliatory in nature. Therefore I have been reluctant to enter my opinion here, because of the prospect of further such actions. In my opinion this editor would use his stated interest in locking articles after he applied his desired changes. His deletionist attitude is extremely worrisome, especially since he appears to actively and aggressively pursue deletions instead of finding ways to salvage and improve. As an administrator he should be able to abstain from active pursuit or voicing opinions about such actions, rather act in the sole role of executing editor consensus. An administrator should rank below editors in status, and should perform the elevated powers with expert efficiency and skill at the discretion of editors. While he has the skill and knowledge, an administrator however should be a support and service person to editors, not a superior or dictator. In this regard, it appears the candidate is not a proper match for the position. The candidate had a previous failed request for adminship. While the nomination text above states that the candidate has learned from experience, the reality of his track record and the reflection thereof in this poll do not bear this out. The nature of complaints against the candidate are much of the same nature and the numerical level of opposition is much the same if not higher. Since the candidate presumably knew of his future desire for adminship, he should have exercised extreme care not to raise any concerns or controversies over his record in the time since his first request, yet he obviously hasn't done so. From this fact, one cannot expect that he will exercise restraint once bestowed adminship."

This is clearly counter-logical - policies are only policies  because they have broad community-wide consensus; they clearly cannot be overruled by a small local majority on an AfD.  That way lies anarchy. [[WP:CONSENSUS]] states this clearly - ""Consensus among a limited group of editors, at one place and time, cannot override community consensus on a wider scale. In the case of policies and guidelines, Wikipedia expects a higher standard of participation and consensus than on other pages."" Meanwhile, in his answer to question 7, this editor has then contradicted himself by saying that he would close an AfD as ""Keep"" when the consensus, such as it was, was clearly ""no consensus"" - he can only have arrived at that conclusion by discounting some of the votes!.  This is somewhat concerning given that the user has indicated a desire to close AfDs and I think they may be a bit too close to this subject to look at the subject impartially.

Moonriddengirl,FlyingToaster,-1,-1,2009,"12:55, 24 February 2009","'''Oppose'''. I certainly agree with Neuro that this candidate is cordial and collegial in conversation. However, I think there needs to be time to process and work as the ""different editor"" she indicates to DGG that she will now become. I acknowledge that she is hardly alone in the rapid-fire tagging of articles for speedy deletion that are obviously incomplete, but our policy ''does'' explain why this is a bad idea, and I believe that an admin should demonstrate understanding of the policy...not only what it says, but why. We need to welcome new contributors not only through one-on-one mentoring, but in a general sense by explaining ""the policies, guidelines and community standards of Wikipedia"" (as per [[WP:BITE]]). CSD is not meant to wipe out incomplete articles with potential; it's meant to summarily remove material that does not and cannot belong. I think this nom demonstrates that she has a clue; I'm glad that she reconsidered this [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anal_dysplasia&diff=272423400&oldid=272422404 vandalism CSD requested, placed on the 22nd]. She certainly left the article in better shape than she found it. But the initial tag was hasty, given the results of a simple google test--11,600 hits for the term. I'd encourage the nom to slow down as she moves forward and to consider alternatives, as the policy says, ""''[b]efore'' nominating an article for speedy deletion...."" (my emphasis). I must also note for the record that I am also uncertain how well this contributor understands [[WP:C|copyright]], [[WP:CITE]] and [[plagiarism]]. As recently as October, she cleaned up the article Army Worm by pasting extensive material from [http://entomology.ifas.ufl.edu/creatures/field/fall_armyworm.htm this source]. Admins only can view the selectively deleted version, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&target=Army_worm%2Fdeleted_revisions_2009-02-16&timestamp=20081019213925 here]. Non-admins, for one single example, compare one sentence she placed in the article: ""For example, Pitre and Hogg (1983) studied winter survival of the pupal stage in Florida, and found 51 percent survival in southern Florida, but only 27.5 percent survival in central Florida, and 11.6 percent survival in northern Florida. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Pitre|first=HN|coauthors=Hogg DB|date=1983|title=Development of the fall armyworm on cotton, soybean and corn|journal=ournal of the Georgia Entomological Society|issue=18|pages=187-194}}</ref>"" The citation there (which is to the Pitre and Hogg article) would seem to suggest that she had viewed the Pitre & Hogg article and crafted a sentence noting their work herself, but in fact that sentence, as with ''multiple'' sentences and paragraphs, was copied directly or with minimal change from the University of Florida profile. This text is not only not public domain, but clearly marked ""Copyright 1999-2005"". In one paragraph, she cited the copied page (though without any indicator that her text was placed verbatim). At best, this contributor did not know as recently as October of last year that she could not paste content from copyright sources to Wikipedia--which would suggest at least one pretty serious gap in policy understanding for a person whose userpage indicates that she has been editing for nearly three years. --"

We had a guy ([[Jon Butcher]]) come in with his PR agent and write a big fluffy article. When people started removing the content as unsourced POV, both the artist and his agent started asking for help at [[Talk:Jon Butcher]].

No time on patrols, almost no user interaction, essentially zero contributions in the ""Wikipediaspace"". A burden of meeting the ""can be trusted with the tools"" standard insurmountable. Also, I'm left a bit confused by the admin as ""career contributors""-- not because I disagree with the idea, but because the nominee has no time spent in NPP or RCP, next to none in XfD and none in DRV CSD or ANI.

Milomedes,Maunus,-1,1,2009,"13:00, 18 August 2009","'''Strong oppose for cause with evidence''' Maunus (1) displayed serious lack of core policy knowledge and/or inability to obtain it; (2) demonstrated unsound judgment in refereeing a dispute; (3) wrote an un-admin-like statement of constructional disregard for WP:BRD consensus editing. Add to these, ''in my personal opinion'', he handled criticism poorly, and displayed a part-time, little-noticed, arrogant aggression. That's an overall recipe for an admin who may too frequently make bad decisions and/or become abusive when he is challenged for any reason.<p>An editor who apparently has not thoroughly read [[Wikipedia:No personal attacks]], and seemingly refuses to read it again when asked, or can't comprehend it, or somehow fails to act on his reading of it, is an unlikely candidate for adminship. Maunus' ability to handle a dispute was incautious  and blundering. When he was challenged, he persisted in fallacious policy positions after he had been asked to read correct policy. Engaging in irrational [[escalation of commitment]] by an admin candidate, who should be on his best behavior, is unacceptable.<p>The locus of the dispute was [[Talk:Cult#Counter-Cult, Anti-Cult, and Cult Apology|here]] (seems to be ended).<p>Maunus charged in to help an ally of his content dispute, but then he casually blundered over the policy line into a PA-by-unevidenced accusation. Initially he didn't know what he had done wrong – which happens to many – but then he aggravated his lack of knowledge by repeatedly ignoring WP:NPA policy reference to his mistakes:  <blockquote>• <small>[[WP:NPA#First offenses and isolated incidents]]: ""Personal attacks do not include civil language used to describe an editor's actions, and when made without involving their personal character, should not be construed as personal attacks""</small></blockquote><blockquote>• <small>[[WP:NPA#Avoiding personal attacks]]: ""Accusing someone without justification of making personal attacks is also considered a form of personal attack.""</small></blockquote><p>Maunus made an accusation of ''""personal attacks""'', and foolishly entered an accusation into the edit summary, where he can't strike it if wrong [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cult&diff=308221227&oldid=308220045], persisted the accusation, with WP:NPA unread or not comprehended or not acted on: ''""You also cannot back up personal attacks with evidence since that is irrelevant...""'' [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cult&diff=308235102&oldid=308233842], even after that charge was declared as wrong with reference to WP:NPA: ''""accusation of PA is prohibited without evidence per WP:NPA""'' [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cult&diff=308233412&oldid=308231670], followed by a more insistent request to read WP:NPA ''""[[WP:NPA]] says that evidenced statements are not considered PAs.""'' <small><small>(because ''""describe an editor's actions""'' implicitly requires evidence)</small></small> ... ''""You can't casually throw around the words ""personal attacks"".""'' [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cult&diff=308252439&oldid=308251792]. Yet he persisted with a ''third'' accusation of violating the ''""letter of WP:NPA""'', plus a co-accusation of ''""WP:CIVIL""'' [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cult&diff=308288252&oldid=308287856] , also proved wrong [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cult&diff=308335288&oldid=308334237].<p>Note the failure of good judgment and loss of emotional control in his re-edit of [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cult&diff=308287856&oldid=308256615 Maunus 12:26, 16 August 2009 (original diff)] to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cult&diff=next&oldid=308287856 Maunus 12:30, 16 August 2009 (re-edit diff)]. In the first diff he mutes the previous overt PA accusations to ''""disparaging remark""'', though that's still covertly a PA accusation. Unfortunately, four minutes later he couldn't resist twisting the knife by persistently adding back in a third overt PA accusation: ''""clearly in conflict with both the spirit and letter of WP:NPA and WP:CIVIL.""''<p>Both accusations referred to an evident statement of fact, in response to a calumny by a third party, as explained in considerable detail [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cult&diff=308335288&oldid=308334237]. <p>That Maunus seemed unfamiliar with [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest]], and had a questionable understanding of it, casts further doubt on his readiness for adminship.<p>How many other policies has he not read well, or does not clearly understand? WP:CONSENSUS? Note his unqualified claim that ''""Major changes may be made to any article without discussion...""'' [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cult&diff=308221227&oldid=308220045],  which is consistent with his lack of regard for WP:BRD editing. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cult&diff=308221227&oldid=308220045]<p>WP:BRD is not required by guide or policy, but it is widely regarded as a model editing practice that good editors, and especially admins, should emulate. I requested that Maunus observe it: ''""...will you honor a WP:BRD revert and discussion or not?""'' [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cult&diff=308233412&oldid=308231670] , to which he replied ''""I am honoring the BRD cycle by discussing this with you.""'' [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cult&diff=308235102&oldid=308233842].  In response I wrote, ''""I see a ""B"" (bold), and a preamble to a ""D"" (discuss), but no ""R"" (revert). In short, you are constructionally refusing BRD editing cooperation.""'' Maunus' ""honoring"" reply is notable for its glossy failure to accept editing cooperation in a BRD cycle, coupled with a disturbingly un-admin-like morph of the facts (""BRD cycle"" with no actual revert), to lightly cover what he seems to know makes him look bad (constructionally refusing BRD). [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cult&diff=308252439&oldid=308251792]<p>Maunus has a different, more controlled self that he projects much of the time. I've seen that controlled, well-mannered self, but then I've known other editors who seemed outstanding as long as one didn't oppose them. A well-mannered self is civilized behavior, and good manners is sometimes a necessary polite fiction, but good manners isn't enough when a non-controlled self emerges under unexpected pressure. Admins face unexpected pressures frequently. As is often said, some people have the temperament to be editors, but not admins. My judgment of this editor is: not ready to be an admin.<p>Whatever, it looks like this nomination will sail through, so I'm serving notice of a personal dispute. Maunus is not to use his tools, or suggest his possible use of them in regard to any situation involving me.<p>I apologize for the page bloat of this oppose, but future victims of poor judgment, if any, deserve to know that there was a precursor to their plight. Hopefully, some other knowing admin would step in to help them."

There is evidence of increased maturity, but when I occasionally see his work he still does not seem very good at understanding the concerns of other editors or explaining his own position. He has a history of starting grand projects, currently [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Outline of Knowledge]], without consultation and then enthusiatically and energetically pursuing them however many toes he treads on.  I'm concerned that as an admin the tools may be inappropriately used, and some other users feel intimidated, in this process, especially as he gives no specific reasons for needing the tools.  Despite the huge edit count, I also think his article writing experience can be questioned. Under half of his edits are to article space, & I'm guessing the great majority of these are to lists or outlines. I've asked a supplementary to the usual Q2 on this.

Balloonman,decltype,1,1,2009,"15:01, 24 June 2009","I explicitly looked at the oppose raised by Maxim, and have say that it is the reason why I am supporting.  [[Michael J. Levine]] which Dec tagged for prod, and Maxim claims should have been deleted A7 does make a credible claim to significance.  It claims that Levine was the star in a viral video.  A7 does not require that the claim be true or even sourced, it only has to be credible. The viral video, made the following claim, ''The film won the award for Best Comedy [at the [[Campus MovieFest]] national competition] and has had continued success as a viral video on YouTube.'' [[Hong Kong Trade Centre]] is clearly about the building, not a business as Maxim claims.  As for [[Rajko Purovic]] the article included two sources, [http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/boro-fc/boro-fc-news/2009/06/10/boro-close-in-on-serbian-striker-84229-23834702/][http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/boro-fc/boro-fc-news/2009/06/09/future-may-lie-at-home-for-huth-84229-23822782/] both of which reference Rajko.  Two days AFTER dec worked on the article, it was discovered taht Rajko was a hoax and that the sources were duped.  How you can blame Dec for this I don't know, because he never edited the article after it was deleted---once let alone three times as claimed in the oppose.  (Dec's last edit 12:42 on June 12, first of 3 deletions 23:58 on June 12.)  How about [[Statian Rummy]] Maxim says this was a clear hoax, but according to [[WP:Hoax]] [[Wikipedia:HOAX#Dealing_with_hoaxes|Note that hoaxes are generally not speedy deletion candidates. It is usually not enough for just one or two editors to investigate a hoax.]]  While this may have been a hoax, it was not such blatant vandalism that having it around for a few days (tagged for deletion) would cause problems.  The article, at least when Dec edited, gave the rules for a variation of Rummy.  Even if made up, it is in no way a CSD candidate.  As for [[Business Development Centre (Hong Kong)]] and [[Deep central]], yes they probably are CSD candidates, but I would much rather haver a person err on the side of caution than go off half cocked and delete everything under the sun.  Deep Central did make a vague claim to significance, but not one that generally would save from most CSD'ers (including myself). There is a reason [[WP:WIHSD|Why I Hate Speedy Deleters]].  (I will admit, the answer to number 6 is a concern, if an article is mistagged, assume it was tagged wrong by mistake, you WILL delete articles with the wrong rationale, it happens.)---'''"

The fact that people are not citing more recent problems is  an indicator that issues are not ongoing.  Raul's criticism is extremely concerning, but it is still old.  Yes, Q5 is of some concern, but he says that he never closed and AFD and doesn't intend to.

In these instances, where the user is attempting to write an encyclopedic article, the correct thing to do, in order to show your support for a community-written encyclopedia, is to help the new editor out, not to go for an A7 speedy. An A7 speedy is a matter of judgment, again, this is just my opinion, when an article shows an attempt at including encyclopedic material, even if a specific assertation of importance is not made, and the editor is new to wikipedia, erring on the side of assisting the editor rather than stomping the article out could gain two things: an appropriate article and a new editor. A7 kicks them both out the door. In addition, oppose per ϢereSpielChequers, Shawn, and Hullaballoo. You're just too fast and inconsiderate to newbie or struggling editors, imo. There is no reward for deleting articles quickly. And I've had an article tagged for speedy within seconds of creating it.

I really don't like biting newbies in this way. Please, stop competing for the fast/most deleted articles award, consider other means of dealing with bad articles, such as assisting the new editor when the article is well-written but lacking a criterion for inclusion, rewriting part of the article, looking for copyright violations (serious issue, that), then come back for adminship showing you consider wikipedia something anyone is welcome to edit.

Obviously Everyking doesn't reflect the midpoint on community thinking on consensus but how is that going to affect them as an admin? I can't see any situation where their philosophy is going to lead them into a dispute where their skewed thinking on consensus is going to lead them into a rash action.  They certainly won't be blocking established users through it and no AFD closed that way is going to survive review at DRV so I simply can't see the harm that giving them the tools will create. Its also fallacious to suggest that being an admin gives you extra weight in a discussion - its the validity of the comment that counts and I strongly dispute that a consensus of average editors is going to be swayed by some of the more crackpot ideas espoused by Everyking. So what does that leave us? An experienced, technically able editor committed to the project who isn't going to misuse the powers that being made an admin will give them but who will be able to contribute to the project in a broader way. I guess that makes me a support although my intention when I came to this discussion was to oppose."

I think she has demonstrated the personal maturity necessary for the admin role -- including the good judgment to stay away from matters she doesn't understand. I have, however, been vaguely bothered by an apparent high tolerance for bad writing, both in sources (for example, illustrated by [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Did_you_know&diff=prev&oldid=286652726 this DKY nom], which she rescued nicely after the issue was discussed) and (as indicated by the fact that she has inserted them into hook sets) in poorly worded hooks nominated by others. Now that I know that she is young, I recognize this (particularly the tolerance for meaningless blather found in music reviews) as youthful inexperience, and I hope Jamie will recognize that this is an area for future growth. --"

That said, it is also true that many functions of admin work are much more nuanced than button-pushing and there is nothing in this contributor's history to show they have either the temperment or the judgement to fill these functions.  Regardless of the candidate's stated intention to stick to vandal fighting for the time being, I cannot support handing the mop to a candidate who has no demonstrated capacity to handle the rest of its functions."

So in the end, I deleted a page that should have been deleted, by I used the wrong criteria, and then overturned by own decision, which would have been correct... I think... ah never mind... still trying to figure out exactly what I did. The point I'm trying to make is that admins make mistakes because they also happen to be humans (unless they happen to be a bot, or a bot-human hybrid). A good admin is someone who is willing to take the advice of other editors. I think that Mayalld has reasonably expressed an intent to look before leaping, and Mayalld's overall history doesn't give me the impression that we cannot trust them. The criticism in this RfA is good, and Mayalld has taken it well, and constructively. That's good, and should shed some light on what type of admin he would be."

As an interested member of WikiProject Law Enforcement, I easily see an analogy between Sysops and cops. They have special privileges, among which the most powerful may be the taking away another's rights (arrest/imprisonment analogous to blocking) and destruction of that which is deemed contraband (seizure of contraband analogous to deleting pages). In both cases, the individual responsible for upholding the policies and procedures, and, in effect, the opinions, of the population must be one in whom absolute trust can be confided. Perusing this editor's history, I have seen very little that would raise questions about his integrity. His current activity, or lack thereof, in, for example, usernames for administrator attention, seems of little relative concern. Based on my judgment, he will be willing and able to follow the correct procedures throughout the project, and do what becomes necessary for maintaining the smooth operation of the English Wikipedia. I liken him to an officer who is concerned primarily with traffic. Traffic officers constantly come into contact with those who do not act in the population's best interests. They issue citations to violators, and may arrest habitual offenders. This editor's citations, however, are warning templates, and his arrest power, Wikipedia's blocking policy. Too frequently, traffic officers come across crashes and are charged with discovering the cause of the mess, how to fix the problem, and how to prevent problems in the future. Mikaey, I trust, will be able to work collaboratively to discover, fix, and prevent problems. Just because an officer prefers to work traffic, does this mean that they are unable to act as a mediator in heated disputes, assist well-meaning citizens, or contribute in any other way to the operation of the city? Even if all I expected this editor to do was revert vandalism, I would have a hard time opposing this nomination. I can see him quickly becoming an invaluable resource to this project and the community it involves. Should I be in the minority, I forsee him working his way up to whatever high standards will be demanded from an administrator in the future of the English Wikipedia. —"

Whether this is evidence that UIS will make a bad admin or simply that the IRC [[voting bloc]] (""cabal"" is so cliché) has struck again is open to interpretation.

But it's when we get into the arena of BLPs that it becomes a little more important for admins to take certain situations into their own hands, not to thwart policy or the community consensus, but to give them a hand in deciding which way to go when they can't decide which direction the article should go. Now don't take this in the wrong way, I'm just asking you to keep certain things in mind while you go around Wikipedia. I think you'll do fine, and I hope you pass this RFA. --<small style=""color:#999;white-space:nowrap;text-shadow:lightgrey 0.3em 0.3em 0.15em;"">"

Perhaps this will sound like sour grapes, as the comment I refer to was left on my own RfA over a year ago. I hope the fact that this is a neutral and that more than a year has passed will allay those concerns, but perhaps not.

This would go a long way towards encouraging account creation as well… Anything that encourages pop culture editors to get an account and use it is a good thing.''"" ← surely we'd all like to believe that this will magically improve the quality of their edits—as this is the only thing that would outweigh the disadvantages of a ""you must be '''''this''''' tall to edit BLPs"" system (for maximum effect, repeat this 3–4 times with your finger and thumb almost touching)—but I do not believe the criteria are enough to make a practical difference. Consider how many pages on your watchlist have seen page-move vandalism in the last week or month, then try telling me with a straight face that the same criteria will stop anyone with the knowledge and determination to add content that would credibly defame a person. On top of that you'd have the arrogance to expect the subject of an article to wait four days and make ten edits to pages they don't care about (bulbasaur perhaps) before being able to remove libelous statements introduced in the eleventh edit of some other user who registered four days earlier. You would also eliminate the possibility that a particularly bad edit can be traced to an ISP without the need for checkusury and subpoenas, and increase the likelihood that the same content would instead be added to a non-BLP article closely related to the subject, just like any burglar would try the windows and the cat-flap too after finding the door locked.

Also, you have created only 16 mainspace pages (plus a number of redirects) in 12,000 edits.  Those 16 are for the most part solid pieces of work, and I liked the Beatles timeline in particular; I'm not one of those who usually oppose for lack of content contributions, but I think in your case the situation is quite extreme.

My impression of Tango has been as a user who has trouble accepting feedback and opinions when those opinions conflict with his own and his responses on this page are pretty consistent with what I have noticed in the past. There was an incident at [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive163#Goa_Inquisition|IncidentArchive163#Goa_Inquisition]] where Tango expressed some very similar opinions and attitudes to what he has said here on the issue of acting when ""involved"". Various people tried to tell him that revert warring with admin rollback and then protecting the article on his preferred version and threatening to block users he'd just been edit warring against is really not appropriate. As Dmcdevit said at the time: ""This isn't something we can agree to disagree about; this is about sound administrative judgment, which, as long as you defend any of those actions, I must conclude that you lack"" and ""I am absolutely flabbergasted that you seem to see no difference between ""threatening to block people for incivility"" and threatening to block people you just reverted for incivility. That is not simply enforcement of policy; that is out of bounds."" Sure, this was a long time ago but Tango's comments about blocking MONGO etc certainly give the impression that even after all the endless discussions, with two years of experience, the arbitration case etc, he still fails to ""get it"", that his approach to adminship still hasn't changed one little bit and that he is still out-of-whack with where community attitudes and standards have been for a very long time. I understand RFA can be very stressful and upsetting but I feel his responses on this RFA show that he's simply not suited to adminship and I think it would be a very bad idea (for Tango as well as the community) to return the admin tools to this user."

I understand the concern with a fifteen-year-old candidate - hell, thinking back, there's no way I would have made a good admin at fifteen. Too volatile, too wishy-washy, zero confidence. However, Dendodge has not exhibited ''any'' of these traits - and really, that's all I can judge by. I don't subscribe to the whole ""stop the ageism"" babble, and I have to have ''some'' evidence that the candidate is mature, even-keeled, and thoughtful. I've looked through more than enough contributions, and I really can't find a damn thing that concerns me. The other oppose I can understand is the admin experience issue, per SoWhy. My thoughts on this are probably not standard - I don't put as much stock in airtight-accurate CSD tagging as most people do. I am not judging other people, and there are probably several reasons why I should consider changing this opinion. However, as it is, I think that ensuring that a deletable article fits snugly into an arbitrary category is secondary to ensuring that Wikipedia contains good, solid, notable, verifiable articles. If an article is spam, but tagged A7, I couldn't give a shit. From what I see, 98% (at least 95%, if we don't want to be exaggerating) of Dendodge's tagging is accurate. From my experience, admins are typically a lot more careful when ''actually deleting'' than when they were just CSD tagging. I just can't see any potential of Dendodge becoming an admin who is wantonly deleting articles - and really, that's the sort of thing by which we should be judging a candidate. Therefore, for want of reasons to oppose, I hereby support."

I will not rehash here the arguments made by myself and others: they are easy enough to find by following the above link. In any case, his behavior at that time made a strong enough negative impression that when I saw him running again, I thought I ought to weigh in. After reviewing BQZip01’s contributions over the past several months, I admit that he seems to have reigned in his aggression considerably. That said, I still have concerns: his initial draft of an answer to question 3 [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:BQZip01/RfA4&diff=next&oldid=282017465] regarding the events with [[User:Cumulus Clouds]], written just over a month ago, to me shows the same inability to walk away from arguments. The much-edited final answer still shows him rehashing the same arguments and still laying the bulk of the blame on an editor who is dead and cannot reply. As I recall, neither party in that dispute acted impeccably, but BQZip01’s steadfast refusal to admit a share of the blame – “probably should have reacted better” doesn’t quite cut it – is disturbing. In sum: I am not confident that this user has genuinely resolved the issues of temperament and problems working with others that concerned me in the first place."

In theory, A7 is supposed to be a simple question, but good A7 taggers try not to delete articles that might meet the notability standard whether notability was asserted or not, which means they're trying to decide quickly what normally takes the work of many people over 5 days.  It's not surprising that A7 taggers get confusing advice.  [[WP:CSD G12]], copyright violation tagging, is often done wrong, but you'll see on the talk page of this RFA that she's done a phenomenal amount of tagging in the last 15 days or so, and got all of these right.  I'm not happy about some of the A3 decisions, but thjtaggers are rarely getting any feedback about A1, A3 and G1.  It's my fault that I didn't look more closely at her tagging contributions before now, and that I didn't know more about what goes on at CSD, but now I have and I do, and I'd really like her help as an admin at CSD. - Dan"

(First, let me say, I will assume that whatever Buro closes this has an interesting ""mess"" - they will need to immediately remove any oppose !vote that says even partly that it's because of age).  One of the most interesting things, and one of the reason's I have waited was to review Bug's responses to the oppose !votes.  Sure, he has clearly tried to argue the opposes, but has done so using ""real life"" situations.  Indeed, when he found any oppose !votes that he considered valid, he has already taken them as constructive criticism. Having viewed a number of his recent edits (especially at ANI), one can readily see that he has adapted/adopted suggestions. I think this shows an editor who was already strong in many regards, but remains willing to '''learn''' - he realizes he's not perfect, so is willing to listen.  With his original strengths, plus the ability to adapt, I believe this more strongly shows his admin-ability. ("

Second, not enough experience in the deletion field; that is, you need to have more experience in XFDs and more participation in the deletion process as a whole. You can build experience and knowledge in this by participating in [[WP:XFD|XFD]]s, utilizing [[WP:PROD|proposed deletion]], watching [[Special:NewPages]] for pages that fall under the [[WP:CSD|criteria for speedy deletion]] (this is where most speedy deletions happen), and participating in [[WP:DRV|deletion review]]. Third, while wikignomery can be a good thing, you need to build knowledge in the article building process—be a good ''content'' editor. Build up and improve existing articles and cleanup substandard articles. This will definitely help you familiarize yourself with the basic Wikipedia policies and guidelines that admins need to understand well in order to utilize the tools. Hopefully, this helps, especially if you wish to go for RFA again."

But I have to oppose because Hawkeye7 has yet to give a convincing reason for why he wants adminship. He hasn't indicated an interest in working in any admin areas, and his experience with CSD and deletion discussions is minimal. His tools would merely be self-serving, and while there's nothing wrong with that ''per se'', I would much rather see the mop given to a candidate that is going to use it in admin areas on behalf of the community.

It would be naive to expect that any faulty use of references would never be discovered in such an environment and I don't think anyone is that naive. If anything happened it must have happened because of simple human error or, at worst, overenthusiasm. Both of these faults are utterly reversible and redeemable. Eventually other editors will step in and fix the contested edits. In the process the editor in question will learn and improve and I'm sure he will not repeat this mistake. Isn't there a place for redemption in the RfA system? No second chances? No learning from mistakes? Why so much mistrust? Why so little leeway for people to overcome their faults?

''Almost'' as troubling as imagining Dave channel said writing skills when trying to explain, through writing, an administrative action. Sorry, but poor writing alone is recipe for drama on a text-based medium. Wouldn't hire a blind man to drive a bus, don't want an admin on an online encyclopedia who can't write. The ref forgery is the second layer of this putrid German [[Coprophilia|scat]] cake - I'm guessing it was done mostly to herd articles through the DYK/GA/FA process to collect those precious stars - which incidentially highlights just how meaningless those processes are. I would consider it admirable dedication if this were a RPG, but this is, in theory at least, an encyclopedia. Regardless of intent, the bottom line is that this sort of trickery is perhaps even '''more''' damaging to an encyclopedia's reputation than if he were forging references to support wonky POV - wonky POV tends to be self-identifying, sourced or not, but it can be hard to figure out what is strange, but true information, and what is mere urban legend."

Combine this with the fact that the user intentionally edited main space to increase his chances of passing RfA, and telling us he wouldn't have done so had he passed RfA before, leads me to believe that his 'good' behavior of the last few months has been a facade. I don't want to think of the kind of behavior we'd have to tangle with should this person pass RfA. Instead of just tagging things speedy, he'd delete them right off [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chubbennaitor/Graah&diff=prev&oldid=255582486]. Not good. Not good.

The problem is occasional ill-considered and non-consultative decision-making .  I was very reluctant to oppose such an excellent editor, but  I simply do not trust him to follow the rules, and not following the rules while having the admin powers to delete & protect -- the very fields he intends to work in--is very worrisome.   He prefers to do what he thinks is right, using whatever rationale is at hand.  '''One''' As for my qy, removing a mis-spelling  or mis-formatting is good work, but given that the mistake is made fairly frequently--not that people think it right, I suspect it's simply a mechanical mistake in letting go of the shift key too soon-- so it will be searched for, too. Redirecting to the right form is sufficient to teach the lesson. It is against policy to remove redirects from spelling errors,  unless they are one-time freaks. That's the right policy, too. Our primary goal is to get  people to the information they want, not teach them to type or spell. We're an encyclopedia, not a tutoring service.  '''Two''' Anyone prepared to become an admin should recognize the inadvisability of making major changes--even formatting changes-- in the MOS or other policy without prior agreement.  '''Three''' over-expansive use of delete as nonsense G1, has caused errors, when people don't recognize that something unfamiliar actually makes sense.   '''Four''' deleting because of the ""spirit of A7"" instead of the actual way A7 is worded, is a thoroughly improper  use of the buttons ..  '''Five'''--  today's [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Vacuum genesis]]-- an AfD on a one sentence article 5 days after it was created, instead of asking for expansion and references.  the nom statement reads: ""neutral, listing to generate discussion"".

You just [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MZMcBride&oldid=282507767#Redressing_grievances asked on your user page] for constructive criticism not two days ago. I was actually going to write something there, but it seems pretty moot now. Why did you do that if you were going to run for admin again immediately after you resigned? Why did you not wait for the arbitration case concerning you to finish first? Quite honestly, I think this has been your problem all along: You rush things. You delete ""secret"" pages in the middle of a discussion about them, you delete talk page redirects with no incoming links without asking about any drawbacks that that might have (people had to find out the hard way). So no, I'd like to see you become more aware of your actions first before I support you for adminship. I'd like you to stick to the rules for a while, even if you don't agree with them. Yes, there are backlogs, and I'm actually willing to fully support any admin bot of yours that you will submit to BRFA (assuming the submitted task needs to be done, of course). I'm also willing to block it immediately as soon as it does something it was not approved to do. :) --"

That's fine with me, but that trend is influencing my vote and my rationale.  I'd like to see more edit summaries from Hawkeye and a clearer idea of what kind of admin tasks he has prepared to take on, and I'd be tempted to oppose or go neutral if I thought that the net effect of a failed RfA would be positive: that is, Hawkeye would be motivated to address our concerns, and come back quickly, get the mop, and get to work.  But six months is a long time away, and this candidate has already found his niche, his way of contributing, on Wikipedia; it's unlikely that he's going to cut back on the article work that he does so well just to address concerns of RfA voters, in the hope that 6 months from now, we'll change our minds.  So for me, the trend towards 6-month lag times between RfAs means that I'm not so interested in using my vote or rationale in the hope that it will have some impact; I'm just voting to either accept the candidate in their current state, warts and all, or reject them.  Hawkeye is clearly here for the right reasons, and he's trustworthy and competent.  So, on balance, yes. - Dank ("

We make new people wait longer than that before applying for their initial adminship. Re-admining him now sets a bad precedent.

You wouldn't delete the main page, you wouldn't block Jimbo, you probably wouldn't do anything stupid. In short, you have common sense, which most ""Give me the tools"" people don't have. The questionable thing here is your understanding of policy. While you clearly understand (for the most part) deletion vs. keep policy, there are ''so'' many different areas of work to be done. Sure, there's XfD's, AIV and other vandalism-related things, such as blocking, page protection, etc. (which you mentioned); but there's so much other stuff to do with your brand-spanking-new admin tools. Before doing any of this, however, you really should know the policy behind that feature. Learning policy can be a long and tedious task: You can study at [[WP:BLOCK]] for years, but you'll never really understand it until you've seen it in action (this is just an example; I'm not saying that you failed Q4).

I'm here because CC/Thumperward's encyclopedia-wide editing swaths are difficult to avoid even in out-of-the-way places: that makes my concern a possible community issue. We made a deal to avoid each other in a couple of articles, which he briefly broke, probably because he forgot about it in his high-volume editing haste. This oppose is a warning to CC that he's reasonably competent or better at some things, but not as competent or correct at Wikipedia as I think he has judged himself to be. Within the last 12 months and following his previous RFA, CC has been a shoot-from-the-hip deletionist, who too frequently shoots wrongly, excessively, or unnecessarily – to the occasional point of being a loose cannon lacking sufficient knowledge of guiderules. I don't hold it against him that he undertakes difficult experimental template programming, but when he hits the wall as we all do, I expect him to be graceful about acknowledging his limits in a collaborative environment. Much skilled programming is non-visual thinking, and I consider him to be visually art-challenged in a way that has led to protracted dispute. I can document each of the statements I've made here, but to be a nice guy, helpful to the project, and avoid raising too much dust, I don't want to do so. I think binary programming practice has an tendency to reinforce ""black and white thinking"", which is the exact opposite of cultivating a neutral point of view. I believe analog art and music practice can be a helpful counterbalance to programmer's bias. I recommend that Chris take classes in freehand, sculpture, or graphic art and web page layout, which are likely to be helpful to Wikipedia as well as to his long-term programming career. My conditions for RFA neutrality include CC's waiting until next year, going to admin school, accepting adminship only with recall, and that by subtle daily demonstration, he should incrementally increase his self-doubt to learn to ""know what he doesn't know""."

The ''only'' reason raised in the opposes below is 'hasn't got enough edits; NOTNOW, try again later'. But here we have someone who wants to help us out with administrative work now; why on earth should he be made to wait, or reach some arbitrary number of edits, before we allow him the tools? What possible benefit is there? Does anyone opposing seriously think he's not trustworthy now, but will be in six months, or once he reaches 3000 edits?

Kww will close AfD's (when he does so) in line with his reading of consensus not his own personal beliefs, just as DGG does.

Kids ''in general'' are poorly suited to positions requiring good judgement.  Those complaining that ""age is irrelevant"" here are making the same error we've seen over and over:  Exceptional individuals ''do'' exist, but only a total bonehead would assume that a ''particular'' individual is exceptional, without evidence.  But I'm also going to call out the ""not enough writing"" opposes for being boneheaded also.  We can use admins who function more like janitors than like writers.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Everyone contributes in their own way, according to their skill set and preferences.

Grasp of copyright seems a little weak, but he didn't claim to want to work in images, so I'm not sure all the image questions are necessarily fair.   One of the big issues is that he seems to be simply summarizing existing policy without having given them much thought prior to this.  His answers don't particularly inspire confidence that he could handle synthesizing the spirit of the policies needed for dealing with edge cases.

For now, the basis for my oppose is based upon my overall impression of Orlady. That being, I fear she will be heavy handed when issuing blocks, protecting articles, and dealing with sockpuppets. Also, I get a feeling that she feels this site is a [[WP:BATTLE|battle ground]] and to be honest I am a bit curious as to why Orlady posted a link to attack page about herself. On top of that some of the concerns brought up about her AfD participation worries me, and leads me to believe there is a potential for drama surrounding closures that she would make.

My advice to the candidate is to explore other areas of the admin bit because you '''will''' be asked to take some action regarding them at some point.  Hell, you may find yourself focusing on them.  I figured (and so did most of the ppl voting) that I would focus on AfD and avoid CSD and AIV (since I had very few edits there prior to becoming an admin).  As it turns out, that's not really the case.  I have closed less than 100 (i think) AfDs but I have made thousands of CSD decisions and blocked scores of ppl at AIV.  Working well there has required that I pick up on different norms and procedures and I would have fared better had I been more open to the prospect of doing so prior to getting the bit.  The RFPP questions were an attempt to engage you in a specific question on page protection without just asking you to quote [[WP:PROTECT]].  I had hoped that the answers there would shed some light on where you fit on the ""consensus vs. the right answer"" spectrum (because not everyone is on the same place) and what goes on in your head when you undertake an action by proxy.  You will probably never be asked to edit the spam or abuse filters or asked to process the DYK queue, but I can predict with almost 100% certainty that someone is going to ask you to protect a page or make an edit to a protected page.  Just be sure that you aren't closing off paths for yourself."

Also per weak answer to Q6 (bans can mean you are not allowed to edit anything, community bans for example) and answer to Q7 - I delete my fair share of pages despite hangon tags, but I do it when I know the creator had time to explain it, not because I fail to verify the notability (and A7 is not about establishing notability anyway but about indication it might meet inclusion criteria). The answer to Q8 is correct but the explanation incorrect: If the consensus is to delete, an admin cannot decide to ignore it. The question was not about an AFD discussion as far as I can understand it but generally about consensus. Answer to Q9c is just wrong, 3RR says it's only a violation if you ''revert'' a fourth time within 24 hours. In this example both editors were still within 3RR.

But there's a lot of things in you contributions, which, without a proper explanation (feel free to reply to anything), leaves me unsure. ArbCom disallowed any automated edits from your account, but there's a lot of ''seemingly'' automated (or possibly semi-automated) edits coming from your account, or (obviously there's no way to prove that you were/weren't observing these edits properly) improperly viewed; For example, in June you were going through a lot of redirects (50+) removing any text below the actual redirect (and in some cases replacing it with a redirect template, such as {{tl|R with possibilities}}), but in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Six_axis&diff=prev&oldid=298191860 these] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dhondo_Keshave_Karve&diff=prev&oldid=298192051 two] edits (and probably more) you didn't re-add the {{tl|R from misspelling}} template (even though in both examples it had apparently been incorrectly substed onto the page, rather then transcluded). I feel that if you were reviewing your edits properly, you should have spotted this. The second example is where you were adding [[:Category:Living people]] to a number of article (most of the times you added this it seems fine), but in one case (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Don_O%27Donoghue&diff=291743722&oldid=269350409 this edit]) you failed to remove [[:Category:deceased]] from the article, and even changed the deceased category (which doesn't exist and was (possibly incorrectly) added by a new user) to have an upper case ""D"". Yes, this change is correct in that categories should start with an uppercase, but why did you add the page to living people, ''and'' correct the deceased category? Also, I think your non-admin closure at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Claus Peter Poppe]] was against both [[WP:AfD]] and [[WP:NAC]] (regardless of whether it should have been closed as delete or not), in that you should not close a discussion which you have been part of, and you (as a non admin) should not close a discussion as delete.

Specifically, I see two issues with the answer to question 8.  First of all, the link to [[WP:UP#Images on user pages]] discusses ''images'', not ''links to images'' -- a subtle but important distinction.  More worrying is the willingness expressed to engage in unilateral deletion of the user page without going through [[WP:MFD|the MfD process]] to determine community consensus on the question.  I'm also underwhelmed by the answer to question 6.  <small>I strongly suspect that the word ""or"" was missed by the candidate, or possibly interpreted as an inclusive or.  My interpretation of the question is that it presents an exclusive disjunction.</small>  A generalization like the one put forward -- that policies are about protection -- should showcase a structure to the candidate's views on policy, preferably one that allows voters to understand how the candidate will act in the admin role.  However, what is there is unhelpful in this regard, and merely provides a lightly annotated list of some WP policies.

You answered part of ""why"" on the first part (why is BLP exempt from 3RR) but only answered ""what"" on the second part (NOR, NPOV, etc, can be taken to talk.  Why?)  But that aside, the answer bothers me that you are being too literal on BLP.  BLP, if anything, should be broadly interpreted (see [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Footnoted_quotes/Proposed_decision#Special_enforcement_on_biographies_of_living_persons|special enforcement]]).  If, for example, you are considering a 3RR complaint where one user has reverted a sourced, but tangential rant about a person (ie, Bob was a member of organization X in college last year.  Organization X's leader was convicted of a crime last year.  Here are 37 other things organization X has done over the years), that doesn't fall under ""libellous, biased, unsourced, or poorly sourced controversial material"" (because we're presupposing that every individual statement in there is sourced) but it darn well should be removed and no wikilawyering should result in it being a part of the article.

It was rather contentious to say the least, and I think with good reason (I did not participate). Despite the fact that we often think in ""Wikipedia time"" around here, where a week can seem like a year, I don't think a person's judgment (which is the core issue at RfA) changes for the better much over the course of three months, and there were some real judgment issues discussed in the last RfA. The quick rush to RfA again when WT:RFA seems to be on a recruitment drive gives me real pause. I disagree with Ironholds' contention (which I also, admittedly, see as a bit of a distinction without a difference) that Timmeh ""sees adminship as a hurdle, not the goal."" It seems to me that he very much sees it as a goal (third try, second in a few months, set up by an editor review), and while I know others very much disagree, I'm skeptical of editors who strive to leap through whatever hoops there are to gain adminship. Timmeh was criticized for poor AfD research and rationales last time so he has made a point of working on that which is obviously good, but it has the feel to me of going through the motions in order to be able to pass RfA the next time around (I know there's a bit of an AGF failure there, but that's how I see it). Timmeh has commented on 38 AfDs since his last RfA (basically doing 2-3 at a time on a dozen or so occasions), but in looking at all of these I see almost none which are controversial or ""difficult"" AfDs. Basically all required a simple Google News search where it was obvious whether or not the topic had coverage in secondary sources (usually Timmeh did this well enough from what I can gather, though in a still-open AfD [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/IChill Relaxation Shot|here]] I find the sourcing arguments put forward by him to be extremely weak and the Google research not at all carefully done). In a prospective admin who says one of the two main things they will do is close AfDs, I want to see evidence of participation in tricky, close-call AfDs where the editor engages with multiples policies beyond [[WP:GNG]] and with strong counter arguments from other editors. I'm just not seeing that in the recent AfDs, and the previous ones were admittedly problematic in terms of lack of rationale, etc. Timmeh obviously is a valuable editor with a lot of great contributions (and if this passes, as it well might, I'll hardly freak out or anything), but I'd recommend that he not worry at all about RfA/adminship for awhile and then maybe try again in 6 months or so. --"

Aitias,Majorly,-1,-1,2009,"14:36, 28 May 2009","'''Oppose''' There are several considerable points, which do prevent me from supporting. <br> Firstly, Majorly should learn that other users may have feelings that can be hurt by his harsh comments. Generally speaking, Majorly is quite quick with judging, especially on people; for instance: “''[...] his blatant deceiving of the community; his abusing sockpuppeting; his COI voting as an arbitrator.''” ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration_Committee/Noticeboard&diff=prev&oldid=291905827 diff]). <br> Secondly, he should treat others, especially those he dislikes, in a more respectful way; exempli gratia, Majorly regularly calls others [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DougsTech/RFAreason&diff=prev&oldid=288352243 trolls]. <br> An even more important point is that accusing others of sockpuppetry (whilst those claims are absolutely baseless) is entirely inacceptable — especially considering Majorly’s own, long history of sockpuppetry. Two examples: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DougsTech&diff=next&oldid=288306390 1], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/MZMcBride_2&diff=prev&oldid=282554092 2]. <br> Also, Majorly’s [http://wikipediareview.com/ WR] contributions are indeed worrying; apart from the examples named already above by others, another few instances: (1) Suggests I would “''sound like a kid.''” ([http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=23332&st=20 link]); (2) “''Aitias has barely done anything useful in the long term.''” ([http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=23332&st=60 link]); (3) “''Luckily he's lost the little credibility he had completely, and people just look at him [comment: him = Aitias] as a bitter troll.''” ([http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=23332&st=60 link]) <br> Furthermore, Majorly should stop to abuse rollback — [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/MZMcBride_2&diff=282661693&oldid=282661573 this] is an insolence and unbecoming to an administrator. <br> Finally, I have no doubt he'd abuse the tools straigt away, cf. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DougsTech&diff=next&oldid=288306390]: “''The only ""bastards"" around here are sockpuppets like Hammersoft, and game players like DougsTech. It's a disgrace such people are tolerated here. <u> Nothing I can do about it though unfortunately</u>.''” (comment: underlining by me, not by Majorly). <br> Taking all these points into account, I cannot trust Majorly and thus, I have to oppose. —"

On the other hand, this RFA, in the context of the RFAR, suggests a certain stubbornness in response to criticism that's a little worrying.  I'm also worried about the fact that he's ""open to recall"" - as I see it, recall is only meaningful if you ''aren't'' open to advice through normal channels (like a note on your user page, an email, or an RFC).

This editor continued to push a highly biased viewpoint which was opposed by 4 other editors, who all gave clear reasons which cited examples and relevant policies.   This editor's responses demonstrated an unwillingness to compromise or any understanding of [[WP:CONSENSUS]] or for that matter [[WP:NPOV]].   The comment regarding [[WP:GA]] standards - ""Whoever is designating them as GA, if this statement is to be believed, is totally incompetent or has their head in their ass."" does not give me any faith that this editor respects other editors.  Then, after this RfA began - a pseudo apology appears in the [[Talk:Tina Turner]] page in which the editor says sorry for the behaviour but maintains the POV stance.

You seem like you know what you're doing around here, and it wouldn't necessarily be ""bad"" if you're promoted; however, I do have several concerns. What pops out at me the most is the fact that you almost never use edit summaries. Obviously there are more important things to worry about, but I'm of the opinion that admins should use edit summaries where appropriate. After scanning through your contributions (which seem alarmingly dominated by userspace edits), I checked your block log, which led me to [[Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Mario1987|this]]. I'm not familiar with that particular case, so perhaps I'm not getting the full story, but sockpuppetry is a serious issue. I do appreciate that you've been contributing for a year and a half without any similar issues however. In addition, your answers here aren't particularly satisfying; for example, referring to people as ""hard headed"" is not appropriate.

However, this feeds in to my next point, which is the large quantity of edits made using Twinkle. It's an excellent tool and very useful in time saving and vandal patrolling but it's not designed to aid in constructive content building.

Participating in AfDs without looking at policy, ignoring objections to your comments and contributing to the retention of an article for which there is absolutely no justification in either policy, the facts or common sense -- is disappointing, but not enough to vote against a candidate.

Most articles, especially those made by new users, don't appear in a completed state instantly.  A brand new user will often ""test"" the system by hitting save very early in the process.

DGG,CRGreathouse,-1,1,2009,"00:12, 11 January 2009","'''Strong oppose''' An excellent editor, and for the time being, that's what he should stick to. First, with respect to Speedy deletion, he does not seem to understand that deletion is the last resort, that alternatives to deletion should be examined, that thee are many reasons for speedy besides copyvio--which is far from the most frequent reason-- and that for copyvio one does not speedy delete if there is a noncopyvio version, if the copyvio material can be removed, or if the material was not introduced at the same time by a single person. second, the only way to demonstrate understanding of process is to participate in them, and, as mentioned, his AfD participation gives insufficient evidence to judge his understanding & there's nothing specifically related to speedy.  When asked about this, he answered (in essence) that he wanted the authority first and that he would learn afterwards. Third, his approach to problematic situations with other admins seems a little odd---if one actually encountered a situation as extraordinary as Q8, my first thought after an email to the admin would be an email to arb com. Forth, his attitude that adminship is no big deal, is compatible with his casual attitude to the actual tasks involved, which matter very much to the people concerned with the articles. How we treat newbies is a big deal for the future of Wikipedia, and immediately deleting every article that is on its face unsatisfactory is not the way to go with them. (and his unawareness of the degree to which we need newcomers as shown by the answer to Q 16.  I would suggest a thorough reading of Wikipedia polices, some experience at the various boards, and then perhaps an application after some demonstrated knowledge and involvement.

I think that a competent editor with the potential to have the mop is easy to identify. You strike me as someone in that category. I do tend to believe that in order to effectively wield the mop, you need to have been around long enough to discern patterns of behavior so that you can mitigate the frequency with which you get duped by the crazies. Wikipedia is enormous, but we admins are really only needed to deal with a very small percentage of the project. That small percentage, however, is a magnet for drama groupies, vain glories, and imbeciles. From time to time, members of one of these groups gets elected to the admin corps and causes all kinds of problems.

Not being an inquisitor myself, I'm unfazed by brevity. &para; Oh, and the first answers were allegedly terrible. So let's look at these terrible answers, later rewritten. ''First terrible answer:'' our Judith couldn't think of ""any circumstance in which [she] would delete a page despite a Hangon tag"". Well of course there are circumstances in which she should delete them. Let's pretend what I don't actually imagine for a moment: that when she wrote that response she really thought that ""Hangon"" was an amulet against deletion of libel, copyvio, kiddy ""grooming"" or whatever. She'd therefore leave such material undeleted, thereby (a) doing no worse than what she does now as a non-admin, and (b) doing nothing to prevent its deletion by any of the other hundreds (thousands?) of admins. No problem there. ''Second terrible answer:'' she thought that there were ""not many"" circumstances in which ""a non-free photograph of a living person [could] be used on Wikipedia"". This of course is absolutely correct (if incomplete). She added that she'd check. Excellent answer! Except of course that the authoritarian personalities hereabouts want long, deferential, solemn answers toot sweet. Oh dear. &para; So anyway, Moreschi may or may not have done something naughty but it's not him who's up for the ""!vote""; Judith's answers are and were good enough. So yes, give her a mop.

In it, I became concerned by his interpretation that ""berating a long-time contributor"" was inappropriate.

Although Pastor Theo avoided referring to [[WP:CIVIL]], I am concerned about giving this user the ability to block others. However, competence at CSD and XfD attested to by Balloonman, PT's general cluefullness (which I think is demonstrated by his careful handling of religious articles to rule out suggestions of a conflict of interest), and his response to question one where he states his intention to work in areas of deletion rather than blocking means I do not think this a reason to oppose on its own. Despite this, I do not support giving the ability to block to someone apparently so sensitive. Since PT has apparently not been in any stressful run-ins with other users I cannot be certain how he would handle the situation were it to arise (and active admins do have to deal with a lot of abuse)."

I agree with various other supporters who argue that he is unlikely to misuse the admin tools.  I notice that I supported him on his 3rd RFA so it seems natural to support him again.  I do have these reservations and comments though.  I am concerned about his critical attitude of ARBCOM.  Granted, he feels that he got a raw deal from them but I think that colors his overall assessment and that is not a good thing.  An admin needs to espect ARBCOM's decisions and stand ready to enforce them.  Contempt for ARBCOM and its decisions is a bad thing.  Finally, although I personally think an admin should use judgment when closing an AFD, I fully understand his desire to eschew judgment that might be vulnerable to criticsm and hide behind the safety of the raw numbers.  In a somewhat analogous situation, the bureaucrats were harshly excoriated for granting Carnildo the admin bit when his RFA (#3) didn't muster the requisite level of support.  It is the perversity of Wikipedia that sometimes we want it to be a democracy and sometimes we don't.  Pity the poor editor who gets on the wrong side of the bandwagon.  --"

In addition to the diff in the previous RfA in which the candidate referred to editors of opposing wikiphilosophy as ""vandals"" or for calling for blocks for anyone who expressed concern over TTN, a user who was sanctioned by arbcom, and as much as I am reluctant to even bring this diff up, the candidate has say for example [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Notability_(fiction)&diff=265550698&oldid=265549945 mockingly] referred to my old username in a discussion.  Regardless of what you think of someone and I know some have their concerns over why I changed names, but what does that accomplish?  Why needlessly add to the tension?  Moreover, in the admittedly high tension effort to compromise, i.e. where editors concede a little ground, on a fiction notability guideline, please notice such edit summaries as [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability_(fiction)/Deckiller-Sandifer&diff=268940366&oldid=268938952 here], in which the candidate dismisses an effort at concession because in his words he (note the ""I"") does not agree (in many other instances, I notice a lot of not using any edit summaries a la [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Notability_(fiction)&diff=274810224&oldid=274809628] for example and is it really necessary to act so disgusted at others' ideas as if one will vomit?).  Now I don't know the average age of Wikipedia contributors (do any of us?), but the candidate asserts that many articles are simply ""[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Notability/RFC:Reevaluation&diff=prev&oldid=271178743 created by 8-year-olds one Saturday afternoon, and that 8-year-old had an 8-year-old's attention span].""

I am concerned that candidate could abuse tools when dealing with the various editors on the opposite side of the fiction discussions and would not trust to be unbiased when it comes to closing fiction and episode related AfDs.  While I could find few to no instances of arguing to keep articles on fictional characters or television episodes (in fact the candidate argued to delete even in such cases as [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Charlie Harper (Two and a Half Men)]] and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Dammit, Janet (Second Time)!]] and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Dammit, Janet (Third Time)!]] and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Get Back (Demi Lovato song)]], all of which had near [[WP:SNOW]] support for being kept), the candidate has by contrast argued to keep such things as [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fancruft&diff=215058577&oldid=215057825 Wikiproject Fancruft], which was decisively deleted due to overwhelming consensus against the project.

How we deal with the fallout is something that decides our suitability for adminship. Adminship can be the toughest and most enjoyable volunteer job imaginable. It is very demanding of time and energy. You will need to maintain a fairly high activity level just to stay sharp and keep up with changes. If you can do this, take on board any growth recommendations from this RFA, and demonstrate sufficient policy knowledge, you will likely pass in another 3,000+ edits/6 months.

Some fairly recent actions, such the DYK hook, seem to indicate his underlying tendency to consider his own opinion higher than others. This could be problematic if he gains admin tools and starts making decisions contrary to consensus. I also have a general concern about his view on speedy deletion. Although it was a few months ago, I can't help but remember [[User talk:Reahad#Your new articles|this incident]]. To give some background, new user [[User talk:Reahad|Reahad]] created several one-line articles (I believe six) about notable individuals; Chzz tagged all of these pages under A1/A3. The application of ""no context"" in this case was questionable, and along with that, the author was actively starting to expand the articles, as promised in his edit summaries. I decided to decline the CSD tags and keep an eye on the situation, because it only made sense to let the author continue to expand his pages. During this time I had an off-wiki conversation where Chzz considered my use of ""admin discretion"" as bothersome, which [[User:Cubs197/chzz left|in part]] led a [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Chzz&diff=296438827&oldid=296392060 wikibreak].

My main problem with RfA is that while the nomination process seems petty, removing a bad admin is like pulling teeth from Mount Rushmore. Once an admin is in the ranks, it's fairly impossible to get rid of them (assessment based on the comparison of admin removal to user removal). I expect admins to be smarter and more fair than the rest of us. If I go to an admin with a question, i expect them to know the answer or find one in short order.

I also believe they will use the tools to help clean-up the 'pedia (they seem pretty savvy with [[WP:CSD|CSD]], and I recall having seen articles tagged by them. And most of their reports to [[WP:AIV|AIV]] seem sensible, although I think Gordonrox should bear in mind that AIV is for users who are vandalising persistently ''at the time'' they are reported), and help other users to help clean-up the 'pedia :D (something their civility, and interaction with other users shows they are capable of). I'm also encouraged by the fact that Gordonrox has both [[WP:autoreviewer|autoreviewer]] ''and'' [[WP:ROLLBACK|rollbacker]] rights, has never been blocked, and takes part in many discussions (e.g. RfA and [[WP:AfD|AfD]])<br /> All that said, there are some faults, nothing major enough to lead me to oppose, but that I feel Gordonrox should aim to do the following; Cut down on automated editing; there's ''nothing at all'' wrong with it, I just believe that if you do, you will find yourself becoming much more involved in community processes (I'm finding this for myself anyhow). Become more involved in AIV if you plan to work there; watch what happens to your reports (e.g. how long user's are blocked for, when they aren't blocked, and what actions (if any) are taken instead of blocking). <s>Sort out your archives; the last two (archive 4 and 3) are named ""archive 3"" and ""archive3""</s>. Get more experience; something which is going to happen no matter what =D.<br /> Overall, I think Gordonrox is ready for the tools. Unfortunately, it looks like the community is going the other way. But bear in mind that most of the opposes are concerns over lack of experience, and the so called ""drama"" at tedder's RfA.

Jclemens and RayAYang, though, had little argument other than that there were reliable sources that the nickname existed, and that NPOV meant we absolutely had to include it.

By the time you hit 4 reverts in a 24-hour period, the time for ""let's talk this out"" is over and the community consensus, as expressed in the [[WP:3RR|3RR]] policy, is that a block is an appropriate method to prevent further disruption.  The ""backstory"" of the question, I believe, was this: U<sub>1</sub> makes an edit to the article.  U<sub>2</sub> reverts that edit.  U<sub>1</sub> re-imposes the change and U<sub>2</sub> reverts this again.  At this point, both users have made their preferred edit twice, although only U<sub>2</sub> would be said to have two reverts.  Add two more revert pairs and U<sub>1</sub> has made 4 edits, 3 reverts; U<sub>2</sub> has made 4 edits, 4 reverts.  The question: should U<sub>1</sub>, who has not crossed that bright line, but has still made equally as many edits, be blocked along with co-edit-warrior U<sub>2</sub>?  My answer is ""usually"", but good people can disagree.  The answer you gave &mdash; that you wouldn't block anyone and would instead try to discuss it &mdash; potentially leads to increased disruption.

The edit warring blocks are so far in the past that they shouldn't even be considered here. But there are definitely some significant causes for concern. The first part of the candidate's answer to Q9 was fundamentally wrong; that user could be blocked on sight. His answer to Q10, which I asked, left a lot to be desired; it was a short, plain-vanilla response which, while not incorrect, didn't give much insight into his policy knowledge. His answer to Q11 is also very troubling. No disrespect intended, but it made me wonder how this could not be construed as a ""real problem,"" as the blatantly polemical statement on [[User:Die4Dixie]]'s userpage clearly violated [[WP:UP#NOT]]. I don't want to hold the user's association with Die4Dixie against him too much, but it certainly is unfortunate to have a proposed community ban of that user being voted on while this RfA is still ongoing.

I'm concerned about both the dismissive attitude at [[User talk:Jerem43#Re: Message regarding Natick Collection]] (""''I will defer to their knowledge of the English language over that of a WPI college student.''""), and the fact that a couple of days ago, after an admittedly [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shoppers_World_(Framingham%2C_Massachusetts)&action=history vandalistic edit to make a point] by the IP editor (worthy of perhaps a warning) you [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&diff=prev&oldid=302251482 reported] the IP editor you're in dispute with to [[WP:AIV]]. I'm curious why no other attempts at [[WP:DR|dispute resolution]] have been tried. The IP editor's edits to [[Shoppers World (Framingham, Massachusetts)]] can be considered vandalism, but all of his other edits are in good faith, yet you're calling them all vandalism when you revert them. I have no opinion on the underlying content dispute, but I'd welcome some comment by you as to how you plan on approaching this situation if it continues, and how you would have handled that request at AIV if you were an uninvolved admin. --"

I disagree with transparency-based opposition: if A new name 2008 wasn't at least somewhat transparent he'd have never mentioned the old account and would have passed this with no major problems at all; and at least A new name 2008 has allowed someone highly trusted and respected to verify his claims."

There's been an improvement from 2007, when he was blocked twice (once for ''five'' days) for harassment; but he's still no where near the kind of editor this project needs as an administrator. His exchange with ChildofMidnight in oppose #12 is a perfect recent example, if posts to AN/I aren't enough. And User:I'm Spartacus! (your signature is awful by the way <3) brought up the only instance I recall having had any significant interaction with the candidate. Linked in that oppose (#34) is my summed up view of that situation. Sense of humor is awesome, but the addiction to drama is ridiculous. Non-admins don't need to comment on issues raised on admin boards unless they are somehow involved or in a position to weigh in with educated information. Poking, prodding and kicking editors involved in heated situations is unnecessary and inappropriate. The candidate is not here to build an encyclopedia, he's here to feed his hunger for drama. I expected this request, as shown in the aforementioned link, and believe it's obvious that his relentless participation on admin boards has shown his desire to gain power on this website. Despite having told me ""[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Law_Lord&diff=259668324&oldid=259666976 As far as my being an admin, I have no interest in the job, so you're safe.]"" in late-December last year, here he is, just as I predicted.

In addition to things like age there are other physical characteristics, intrinsic psychological and emotional factors, as well as socio-economic and cultural factors that determine the maturity level of a person and we, on wikipedia, have little, if any, access to these other characteristics. Therefore, while age may be a reasonable heuristic in the real world (such as when employing a person) where access to other information about a person is better (school grades, recommendation letters, face-to-face interviews), using age in an environment where all we can see of a person is the words they type unreasonably overweights that single factor. Far better to focus entirely on the typed words. --"

I would have supported TenPoundHammer this time around, but recent interaction with regards to non-free content has shown me he is perhaps not the best admin candidate.

Non-free content guidelines? Non-free content criteria? Who cares? Someone told him they were legitimate, and it's ok, he added some [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Be_Here&diff=308898828&oldid=308898288 original research] to the article describing what the cover looks like.

Regardless of whether you feel that alternative album covers are automatically legit or not (amazingly, there are some widespread beliefs about how we should automatically be using alt covers, but I digress), you can at least see that this really isn't admin behaviour."

Judging by the comments about him, F & W is probably one of Wikipedia's most seasoned editors in this area.  My own experience with F & W has been very positive--in the deletion discussion we were in together, he worked hard to find verifiable references to substitute for the hate sites that were used as references for the article in question.  Although the article was eventually judged unsalvageable and the references he found were not added, I was impressed with his reasoned analysis of the issues at hand and the labor he put into trying a new approach to this very heated discussion.  AfD is a very contentious part of Wikipedia and it's difficult to always agree with a particular editor, but F & W should be good at making sensible decisions and keeping the heat down.  Plus, I think F & W is one of Wikipedia's more modest top editors.  --"

Dank55,Wadester16,1,-1,2009,"16:00, 11 February 2009","'''Weak support'''.  [[WP:TLDR|TLDR]] summary: I think the voters above have searched the contribs and thought carefully, and I can support their conclusions.  The candidate averaged only 5 edits a month before August; I've reviewed the contribs for August and most of September, and they show someone who was sincere but knew very little about Wikipedia ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boris_Johnson&diff=prev&oldid=234428197 this, for instance]), so we're really talking about a candidate with 4.5 month's experience here, the way we generally count things at RfA.  When I supported [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Frank|Frank]] in July, I said: ""Damage is done, of course, by giving what is perceived as a thumbs-down by the ""establishment"" to 19 out of 20 candidates who apply before 6 months of consistent editing"", but the RfA community has matured since July, and I don't think that damage will be done if this RfA fails.  The supporters and most of the opposition are making it clear that we like this candidate but that we have suggestions for things he should learn, for his benefit and for the benefit of the people who will be affected by his actions.  This candidate started off as an [[meta:exopedian|exopedian]], but the candidate's wikiproject experience shows on-wiki social interactions that nicely balance the exopedianism.  The implication I draw from the voters above is that the candidate seems to be on the right track, and it's not worth the extra stress to him or the extra time it will take us to go through all this again just to increase the odds that we're getting it right.  I'm concerned that accepting people before six months of solid activity is going to eventually create a race among prospective candidates to see how fast they can get accepted, and if that starts happening, I would support either a 6-month minimum requirement before running ... or (and this could still happen in this RfA), we could oppose candidates who we think are running too soon, and use the opportunity to give them friendly and helpful feedback, which would have the effect of setting standards as a community rather than passing the buck to admin coaches and other individuals, at the cost of extra work at RfA. - Dan"

Moreover, I recall his close of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Antisemitic incidents alleged to be related to the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict]] as a remarkably bad one, where his closing statement just thrust up an ""AFD is not a vote!"" shield and gave no hint as to why he found one side more convincing. It appeared to me that he was closing it according to his own personal wishes, rather than to reflect the will of the community, and admins are not supposed to use their admin tools in that manner.

I appreciate the valuable contributions the candidate makes to the project, for example in the form of reversion of vandalism, and I appreciate the quick response to my request for a list of articles created.  The candidate seems to be a productive editor and I would like to encourage him/her to continue contributing.  I examined the situations surrounding three messages which the candidate deleted from his/her talk page.  All three were complaints from editors whose edits had been reverted as vandalism by the candidate. Administrators, even more than ordinary editors, need to be open to discussing complaints about their actions. In one case, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Camw&diff=274656789&oldid=274656727 1A], the candidate provided [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:165.124.188.243&diff=274657038&oldid=274656451 1B] a helpful and communicative reply to the user, so that's fine, although I would prefer to see consistent archiving of talk page messages, and although immediate deletion of messages may also impede further communication with the user.  In another case [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Camw&diff=270439811&oldid=270439794 2A], I'm concerned that communication with the user seems to have been cut off [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:160.94.28.163&diff=270439815&oldid=270439632 1B] by calling the posting of a talk page edit ""vandalism"". Although the user's initial edits seem to be clear vandalism, I disagree that the posting of the talk page comment was vandalism.  In a third case, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Camw&diff=270168919&oldid=270168863 3A], after deleting the user talk page comment, as far as I found the candidate didn't reply with any talk page comment but carried on a discussion via edit summary only while repeatedly reverting: not the best practice.

It was brave to select WP:FICT as the policy question, and he is right there is not enough apparent consensus.

As an outside occasional-observer in this long-running Jvolkblum sockpuppet case, I've been concerned about her manner of seeking to enforce a justly-imposed ban: no complaints about her motives, but I fear that her methods made it more likely that innocent new editors could have been caught in the crossfire.  Bear in mind that this is not a deep concern (otherwise I'd be opposing much more strongly), and I've not been closely enough involved myself to speak for certain, but everything that's occurred with this case has made me uneasy with enabling Orlady to have tools that '''might''' (I don't say ""would"") be misused.  In conclusion, the fact that this good editor is receiving such strong opposition from other good editors means that her administrative actions might be fraught with controversy, and I don't think it would help Wikipedia at this time.  If this case ever blows over, or if the disputes related to this case calm down, I'll be more open to a new RfA; but '''right now''' I don't think it's the best idea."

I do note, with some surprise, the ''""using 'negro' is illegal""'' incident, and do kind of wonder, if he had had the tools at the time, if he would have made a mistake with them.  Many of the opposes seem to be based on this incident being an indicator of poor judgment. Since, on occasion, I have actually made a few mistakes in my life myself, I tend to allow others to do the same, and don't think we should be insisting on perfection.  I am convinced by a review of his talk page contributions the last few months that he is open to constructive criticism, and learns from his mistakes. I don't think it's reasonable to insist on more than that.  If Cyclonenim can assure us that, until he gets his bearings, he will err on the side of inaction when he's not 100% sure what to do, and will check with other admins frequently until he's very comfortable with the ins and outs of adminning, then I think he deserves our support. --"

A Nobody,Thumperward,-1,-1,2009,"18:52, 9 March 2009","'''Oppose''' per [[User:A_Nobody#RfA_Standards]].  Thumperward at times can be a civil and constructive editor as when he has suggested some pages I help edit on and as such I am pleased at times to interact with him as an editor.  And for the record, I like the pirate image on the userpage!  My concerns with regards to adminship is how tools might be used based on past interactions.  For example, he was pretty persistent about trying to get aspects of my old userspace undeleted that caused near wheel warring among admins over the issue.  And with regards to AfDs, I am concerned with such instances as [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Abhuman]], i.e. not thinking outside of the box.  In [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Alexander Corvinus]], digging in to delete when a merge as happened was reasonable as a compromise was disappointing.  In [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Alien and Predator Timeline]], we have use of the non-word ""cruft.""  [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Blood Ravens]], why not per [[WP:BEFORE]] attempt a merge or redirect?  With [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Catsuits and bodysuits in popular media]], not suitably acknowledging efforts to improve during discussion.  With [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Eddie Quist]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of fictional characters by IQ]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rabbit of Caerbannog]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Snotling]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Snotling]], and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lathander]] we have a misread of the sources that was obviously inconsistent with consensus.  With [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Horus Heresy]], not objecting to future reuse seems more a call for a redirect with edit history intact to avoid having to request recreation.  Just as with [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of SD Gundam G-Generation F mobile suits]], why not redirect as happened?  With [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Michael Corvin]] and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Suburbs (web series)]], it was just disappointing that when pretty much everyone else is persuaded by the sources that resulted in a keep, to still argue against them.  In [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Coltons]], even TTN didn't seem opposed to a merge and redirect.  Finally in [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User:Stormie/DRV notes]], he adamantly defended something that was speedily deleted.  So, my concern with regards to AfDs are as follows: 1) overly biased tendency toward deletion of fictional subjects, even when they are improved and sources presented during the discussions; and 2) reluctance to change stance during discussions.  It is important for admins to identify trends in an AfD and how the discussion develops when new material is presented and as such based on past experiences, I am concerned that even if an article is in fact rescued that might not be adequately taken into consideration.  So, I am happy to work with Thumperward to improve articles and of the various editors with whom I have disagreed in my time here, I give him a lot of credit for making good faith gestures to suggest articles to work on or to make the talk page archive thing in my talk page when I changed names, but there have been just a few things regarding deletion that make me apprehensive as to what he might try to undelete and how he might close discussions.  So, I am somewhat torn, because I believe he is an editor I can work with, but maybe if he pledged to not close fiction AfDs for which he might be biased (I think every fiction AfD I have participated in with him he said to delete, which is over 30 by my count, and not all of those closed as delete after all), maybe it would be reassuring.  Thank you for your time and consideration.  Sincerely, --"

The niggles and problems with Dave's content contributions (I ignored the PeterDamian circus about 10 lines in FWIW) do not inspire confidence when it comes to assessing his ability to communicate policy and decisions. But its mostly the huge gulf between experience and intended areas of engagement (viz. AFD). <s>Seven months is no way long enough for any but the most improbably clued in and faultless.</s> (Wrong RFA - see below). These require substantially more experience than he can offer. Reassurances of appreciating one's current limitations and proceeding cautiously mean nothing when any such understanding should have precluded accepting a nom in the first place. I expect RFA candidates to be ready to be admins and not inchoate 'gaining experience' echoes."

This editor seems to have an interest in the welfare of the WP and has done good work (albeit in a restricted space -- cycling). Perhaps in future this may add up to a sufficient argument for adminship, but for now there is a strong commitment to enforcing rules with rigor, tempered by personal opinion on which rules/policies are sensible and proper. WP is a neutral place (NPOV and all that), or is meant to be, and admins must (should/ought/...) take the lead in that respect. They must (should...) not adopt this or that position based on personal standards, even if these are essentially congruent with WP:xxx of one kind or another. Other editors have just as much right (or leeway or ...) to edit and to have differing opinions, just as do admins/bureaucrats/steward and all the other inhabitants of our layers of supervision. Admins must (should...) respect this diversity of perspective and freedom to edit/disagree/agree comment without reservation. An analogy might be an ideal baseball umpire, who is resolutely neutral under all conditions. I see too much ground for reservation in this user's comments here in answer to questions and elsewhere to have the required faith in his  neutrality. Wait a while and try again."

I'm sure they mean well, but as Moni pointed out above, their reviewing has been less than stellar, and that continues to this day; this makes me question whether they are capable of and/or willing to assess an article's quality, or if they are just simply more concerned with earning barnstars.  When [[Hell's Gate National Park]] was erroneously passed as GA, I commented on the talk page with my concerns and received no reply from them.  Then, when the same article was taken to GAR in January of this year, still in very poor shape, Ceranthor stated that they ""kind of pass[ed] the article in AGF. Honestly as the primary reviewer I felt it was rather borderline myself, and I'd be glad to participate in bringing it so that it is not quite so close to the edge.""[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AHell%27s_Gate_National_Park%2FGA2&diff=262172707&oldid=261971724]  A few weeks later the article was delisted due to inactivity.

Less than two months ago I saw that they suddenly dropped their review for [[Talk:Capella (star)/GA1|Capella (star)]] after nearly a month of inactivity (according to their contribs he/she was editing actively elsewhere).  They left a cryptic edit summary (""[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Good_article_nominations&diff=prev&oldid=273242253 withdrawing review]"") at the GAN page, but no notice elsewhere.  The review was finished by someone else, and the article ultimately passed, but despite a message on their talk page that is still there now, there was no explanation for Ceranthor's delay or lack of communication.  Bad form; even if they were busy, a quick, apologetic note would have been common courtesy.

In that light, there is nothing obvious to oppose here. Too few edits per month recently? So what? Often contributes to AfD with ""per user"" !votes? What is wrong with consensus building?

In my view the reason why admins should show proficiency with article work is (a) to demonstrate they have an understanding of how the editing rules work in practice as opposed to simply reading the policy pages, (b) to show they are first and foremost here to build an encyclopedia, and (c) to indicate they have some appreciation of the attachment good-faith contributors have to their work and therefore the sensitivity to address concerns re those contributions without unnecessarily offending people. Franamax has comparatively little article-building experience, but the extensive contribution record over the years satisfies me about (a), having regard for the anti-vandalism efforts I have no especial reason to doubt (b), and there are enough testimonials about co-operation with others that I am at least tolerably happy with (c). Others might disagree, but I can't see anything that would disqualify Franamax from adminship, and I see a fair bit that supports the contention that he would continue his good work with the aid of a couple of extra buttons.

The oppose votes are all tired variations on the don't like his deletion attitude blah blah blah. Well, frankly, 1) we should have admins who come from all corners of the spectrum. We have arch-inclusionist admins (DGG) who do an excellent job and don't misuse the tools. 2) We have mechanisms for censure and redress in the event that admins are routinely letting personal bias interfere with interpreting community decisions. If the only outstanding objection of substance is this BS about how TPH behaves at AfD then we need to amend the process by which admins are selected b/c the process is broken. Show a consistent pattern of incivility, ownership, poor edits, pointy behaviour or biting newbies, ok those are reasonable grounds for objection. But what I see is mostly personal disagreement over wikiphilosophies masquerading as principled objection in faux-ingenu tones. I respect editors' right to oppose. But opposition to a candidate with ''over 100,000 edits'' should require more serious engagement with the editor's record."

I have supported Kevin in the past and do believe he can be a successful admin if he takes valid concerns on board. It is my hope that he will do so. This RfA should pass; part of why I'm revising my 'stance' is that I consider a fair chunk of the opposition to it to be pure tosh; this is also part of why I'm moving all the way to support instead of to neutral. Factor out the battleground opposition and we're left with an admin candidate with better than 80% support and some feedback on offer.</p><p>Editors such as Ikip and A Nobody are endlessly disruptive as is shown by their tag-team approach and the endless distractions from core issues and their attempts to entangle threads with other issues.

I hope that Kevin will take another look, too.

But adminship is not a cop's badge or a gun with which to put down the rabid. Too many wannabe admins are only after the block and deleted functions. Adminship changes the way you see the wiki. One of the obvious ways is all the 'block' links on offer; really, there are too many, as is shown by folks occasionally blocking themselves, Jimbo, or some innocent by mistake. But it also brings a sense of responsibility. Adminship is 'tools' on a technical level, but it is about 'voice' on a social level. The best admins are people who listen and are listened to.

I am impressed with his technical ability, but dismayed by his failure to consult, and generally to respect Wikipedian norms of transparency and due process. A few of us initiated a move to highlight text using a template, and Headbomb took up the task. The result was <nowiki>{{xt|}}</nowiki>: quite useful for exhibiting examples in the guidelines at [[WP:MOS]] {{xt|with distinctive styling like this}}. But Headbomb did not wait for consultation and refinement to be completed; he began implementing the template at [[WP:MOS]]. At first I reverted this, providing a sandbox instead and urging patience, but to no avail: see the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style/Archive_107#Using_color_and_typeface_to_set_off_example_text_on_MOS_and_MOSNUM archived discussion], starting at the words ""MOSNUM is locked down"". A couple of days later another in the ""act now"" faction unceremonially removed the last chunk of the discussion and pasted it as the beginning of a talkpage for the template itself: [[Template_talk:Xt]]. See my comment at the bottom of that talkpage. (Protocols for the new highlighting are still not settled at MOS, so it is still not uniformly applied.) I noticed that editors began staying away; I suppose they felt as I did. In any case, soon after, because of such difficulties (in particular involving another editor), I absented myself from MOS editing for six months, feeling that it had become unconsultative and unproductive. I do not think that Headbomb has shown proper consideration and restraint, or the sort of collaborative orientation that we should expect in our admins.

I see a better analogy as a referee. Many people feel that it is important to have played the sport to be a good referee; there are referees who have never played the sport, and some are quite good at it, but you start with a strike against you. I see the candidate as an excellent contributor to the encyclopedia—but to abuse my analogy, somewhat of a special teams player. Not intended to be a negative, I'm a big fan of special teams players, but one doesn't assume a complete understanding of all facets of the game by such a player. One doesn't even assume this of other positions—I think Tom Brady is an excellent quarterback, but I don't know if he would automatically be a good referee. I am fairly confident if you told him he had to ref a game later in the season, he would start paying attention to things in a different way than he would as a player. I think we've done a bit of a disservice to the candidate by nominating for the position without giving a proper heads up. The position absolutely (and appropriately) requires a solid understanding of a wide range of policies, some of which you may not have encountered as a editor. The position also requires a mastering of jargon, so that certain terms have special meaning, such as cool-down blocks. I see nothing wrong with blocking a disruptive editor, but that isn't exactly an example of a cool-down block. I I'm confident that if candidate is interested in the position, and spends a few moths reviewing policy, that the support level will be extremely high.

Maturity issues will, in most cases, fix themselves over time - like poison ivy, there's not much one can do except simply wait out the storm. ""Trying to"" fix maturity issues is both counterproductive and indicative of a journey towards maturation that is still a bit shy of the promised land.

Of course, one would assume you speak of the hypothetical ""event"" article, but communication of this nature is confusing, and, in the course of administrative functions, has a tendency to provoke (unwarranted) drama, and a tendency to either unintentionally fan flames, or, at best, do absolutely nothing to resolve situations.

While most of your work at WQA is stellar, if you want to be an admin in dispute resolution you have to be less biased and much more civil. The answers to questions 1 and 3 (both dealing with conflicts in the past) are in a haughty tone that isn't befitting of an admin working with dispute resolution. Also, as noted above, some of your AfD closings were much too contentious for a non-admin to handle. One such close was overturned at DRV and several weeks later another went there where you closed an 8-6 debate per WP:SNOW. These two concerns put together lead me to question your judgement and at this point in time I can't trust you to make sound AfD closes or neutral blocks. '''"

I notice that among the recent AfDs on his user page, he has voted keep on 1% of them  (the one I found, curiously was against the consensus). I cannot judge the issues for most of these articles & almost never !voted in the same AfDs as he did--but from what I can judge, I would have agreed with him at least 80% of the time, for it seems he was most of the time making an appropriate concentrated attack on a particularly bad type of articles. However, there's a hugh difference between a keep percentage  of 10% and 1%; one is the proper response to the large amount of junk we have here, the other illustrates dogmatism.  But I do not think this is only about deletionism/inclusionism. I think his attitude towards Fringe science shows a similar dogmatism. And, after all,  Jack Merridew, who profoundly disagrees with me  on that issue,  also is opposing this AfD nomination; there is a common element in our two reasons--an unsuitable persistence in the rightness of his position on things)   I think Kww a very valuable person to have on the project.

Contrary to the candidate's statements, both articles I mentioned contain unsourced statements that are not general knowledge, and interlanguage links do not count as attribution (by that logic, [[George W.

I can certainly see the candidate is a good editor who is committed and beneficial to the project, but these two policies, particularly verifiability, are becoming increasingly crucial as time goes on, and I expect administrators to understand and enforce them. -"

A Stop at Willoughby,Franamax,-1,1,2009,"15:53, 7 November 2009","'''Oppose''' There are way too many concerns here, not the least of which is civility. Reviewing Franamax's history, it seems to me that he has something of a short fuse and a penchant for sarcasm. The diffs highlighted by Durova and his brief mentorship of [[User:Igorberger]] demonstrated that, in my opinion. While Igor was stunningly clueless, I personally think Franamax was overly sarcastic and too quick to lose his temper in dealing with him. He also seems rather argumentative. he other concern, of course, is Franamax's lack of experience in content work. I wouldn't hold a lack of DYKs, FAs, or GAs against a user, but a lack of almost any article-writing experience at all (two articles created, most contributions in article space are vandalism reversions) really concerns me. Article-writing is what Wikipedia is about; while Franamax's activities serve an important function here, I'm concerned that his lack of article-writing experience might result in a lack of appreciation for the problems faced by those who do write articles. Even ignoring the lack of experience in the mainspace, there's the whole issue of lack of experience in administrative areas of the Wikipedia namespace, which Franamax readily admits in his preamble. Franamax says he'd be dipping his toes into these areas once he gains adminship; I say, why should we grant adminship to someone who'd be mainly learning on the job? This is not to say that Franamax would be a poor administrator &ndash; I think he can be trusted not to abuse the tools &ndash; but I don't think he's got enough experience for the job, even with 12,000 edits.

The first answer, from {{user|ukexpat}} pretty much answers the OP's question - maybe a little on the brief side, but it's there. Teratornis' answer, however, would just leave a newbie scratching their head saying ""WTF? That may be an answer to ''some'' question, but not the one I asked"". His contributions to the Help Desk are littered with examples like that, and if people want I'll dig out more. They're verbose, frequently obtuse, and as a net result somewhat counter-productive. The Help Desk is not the place for long expositions on what Wikipedia is or isn't, or philosophical tracts  on any number of topics - it's for people to get answers to their questions about how to use it. All too often in his longwinded (although well-motivated, I have no doubt) replies, Teratornis forgets that. If that same approach is extrapolated out to administrative actions, and there's nothing to indicate that it wouldn't be, then I cannot see that it is conducive to being a good administrator - clarity and conciseness are two of the attributes that I look for in an administrator and their dealings with others, and I don't believe that Teratornis would display those. <small>"

Contrary to others who have said that Orlady was justified in responding testily to Geronimo20's ""offensive"" comment, the mistake Orlady made was in her assumption of what the problem was in the first place.  She could have started with a question, or even an apology, without the sarcasm (it wouldn't have cost her much, I promise).  I could have understood, perhaps, if her response were short, quick, and snappy.  It's easy to be uninentionally sharp if you're saving your first, quick reaction.  But her response is long, and she simply must have previewed, and searched for all of those diffs.  That she didn't, at some point during all of that, think, ""maybe this is just a little bit of the wrong approach . . ."" shows a lack of restraint and self-awareness, in my opinion.

For my complete views on it, see [[WT:RFA]]</small> BobtW gave an answer that is pretty by the book, and thus lends itself to an easy support. It showed a level head and concrete thinking, however, BobtW did not address the BLP issue at all, which was a critical aspect of all of this. (To BobtW's credit, he pointed out the RS issue) Administrators must keep the end goal (the production of good content) in mind when dealing with poor conduct. Recent months have shown fairly conclusively that BLP errors are ticking time bombs. I still vote to support because I believe BobtW will take my advice on this manner and accept it as a learning moment and has demonstrated traits that suggests that he is dedicated to keeping things in proper perspective.--"
Jennavecia,MZMcBride,1,-1,2009,"13:07, 8 April 2009","'''Strong support''' - I don't always agree with MZMcBride, in fact, when it comes to WP-related stuff, we usually disagree. However, in the many debates/arguments (sometimes heated) I've had with MZMcBride, one thing has always been clear, and that is how passionate he is about this project, and I've never questioned his intentions for any of his actions, no matter how much I disagree with them. I think it's clear that he does what he believes is best for the project. As far as this RFA coming so quickly, I thought it was too early as well, but knowing MZMcBride as I do, I did not believe it was an appropriate desysop, and many editors I spoke with agreed. ArbCom decisions should reflect community desires. I don't believe this RFA is to disregard the AC, rather than to confirm that MZMcBride's loss of the tools is the community's true desire. His work in the area of BLPs is prolific. A #1 concern of the project should be cleaning up and protecting living subjects of articles here. While that's not currently the case, it is a #1 concern of his. We need more admins with such a focus, not less. Hopefully the AC case has been a bit of a wake-up call and we'll see a change in the way he communicates."
NuclearWarfare,Until It Sleeps,-1,-1,2009,"15:41, 1 February 2009","'''Oppose''' - I didn't want to oppose this. In fact, I feel like I probably should have stayed out of it. But I'm going to tell you bluntly that unless you undergo a major personality shift, I cannot support you, for several reasons. I have no problem supporting vandal fighters. But they cannot be just pure vandal fighters who have never tried their hand in anything else. You have not tried your hand in any form of article writing, or worked in Requested moves, or helped along in a major policy discussion, or something like that. I don't care if you come out of it with an award from [[WP:GA|one]] [[WP:DYK|of]] [[WP:FL|those]] [[WP:FA|places]], but there are some things that you can only learn by getting into article writing. Secondly, when you work on Huggle, I've noticed that you seem to brag about ''your'' editing speed. Such a thing is not healthy. As an admin, one has to remember to act slowly and deliberately <small>(maybe I should listen to this advice too)</small>. I don't believe you would abuse the tools, but I don't think that at this moment, you would be ready for them.

Juliancolton,Until It Sleeps,-1,-1,2009,"21:08, 20 August 2009","I find many of the above opposes regarding your reliance on Huggle unconvincing. However, Tan put it well; we always need more vandal fighters, but you have little or no experience in other areas of the project. That said, my main concern is your sometimes immature demeanor. I don't have any diffs to back that up, but as your former admin coach, I just get the feeling that you don't have the maturity necessary to make the difficult, divisive, and important decisions that come with adminship. The fact that you retired immediately upon hearing that the developers were discussing the implementation of flagged revisions, only to return a couple days later, doesn't give me much confidence. If I recall correctly, you also semi-retired a few weeks ago. Instability in that regard is not a favorable trait in admin hopefuls. And as much as I hate to make unsupported claims, you occasionally come across as just a bit desperate for adminship, particularly on off-wiki communication systems. You're certainly an asset to the community with your anti-vandalism work, and I encourage you to keep that up, but at this time, I do not feel I can fully trust you with adminship. Sorry, –'''"

I do believe this user's explanation, and the facts have been verified by ArbCom; so in truth, many of the opposes here are invalid. To characterize this fine user as ""schizophrenic"" or dramamongering is rude and absolutely untrue, and quite needlessly hostile. Katerenka has shared personal details about her situation, including precisely why she has abandoned her previous account, and we are condemning her for it? So what if she's changed her name a few times? Now, that being said, I do believe that Katerenka is not yet qualified to be an admin at this time. I have checked the [http://toolserver.org/~soxred93/count/index.php?name=Javert&lang=en&wiki=wikipedia contributions of Javert], and notice that there is a heavy skew towards the user talk space. These consist mostly of warnings for CSDs and vandalism reversions, but what is left can mostly be categorized as socialization. Further, there are over a thousand edits to the namespace, but once the reports to AIV, UAA, the Huggle whitelist, and the clerking at CHU are all removed, that number becomes quite small. I do not mean to belittle Katerenka's contributions, but merely suggest that we have yet to truly ""meet"" this user, as there is not much in the way of examples of collaborative editing or participation in policy discussions. Indeed, she is having a ""meet""ing problem of her own as she struggles with her identity. She is still in the middle of an extremely volatile period of her life, and I believe that the inherent stress that comes with the tools may not be good for her personal health. Katerenka, you are very obviously a helpful and exemplary editor who will one day be a fine addition to the admin corps, but I would ask you to branch out a little more and gain experience in other areas of the encyclopedia.

Juliancolton,Jerem43,-1,-1,2009,"17:38, 18 July 2009","Changed to oppose per the answer to Q7; AGF only goes so far, and sysops in particular need to understand that. It won't necessarily be ""bad"" if you're promoted, but I can't support due to the concerns raised. On the other hand, it seems you're receiving plenty of constructive criticism, so if you take these comments to heart and work on areas you're lacking in, you should pass no problem in a few months. –'''"

Airplaneman,MZMcBride,-1,1,2009,"15:26, 31 August 2009","'''Oppose''' I am reluctant to edit this section but feel that I must do so. Although I have seen MZM around and he seems like a nice guy, I am a bit queasy when it comes to handing him the mop.  RxS said it very well; I don't like how he has handled the ""delete button"" in the past. Excessive drama was created before when he had access to the ""delete button"", as can be confirmed in his talk archives. Therefore, for my reasons and practically all of the reasons above (except the ""I don't like you"" one), I reluctantly oppose. MZM is definitely here to improve the encyclopedia, but I think he needs a bit more time to settle down after the drama in April."
Floquenbeam,Kww,1,-1,2009,"16:17, 13 October 2009","Kww knows what he is doing. There are several valid points in the Oppose section (in particular, the aggressive over-reaction on the Meursault2004 / BambiFan ANI thread, which left a bad taste and ''almost'' kept me from participating here), which I hope and expect Kww will take on board. Ultimately, I am swayed by his answers to the questions, the way he's handling this RFA, and his overall pattern of helpful, clueful behavior. Net positive, assuming he takes on the constructive criticism below. --"
