That was a no win scenario as Nthep gave a number of answers to cover what he thought was the question. I thought it was fine but the contributor that was asking flipped out and ""nutted"" up. The reason it turns out was the editor did not have even a basic understanding of how to download an image to his own computer and had over complicated his question so much it was impossible for anyone to know their basic limitations.--"

Mr. Stradivarius,Shirt58,1,1,2013,"11:00, 11 March 2013","'''Support'''. I agree with B in the oppose section that the answer to Shirt's questions were slightly off. When asking for review of admin actions, it is better to go to a noticeboard than to ask an admin of your choosing, in order to avoid allegations of favouritism. That's not to say you can't ask an admin of your choosing privately for their opinion, but once things go on-wiki it's best to do everything possible to be fair, and to appear fair. I also concur with B's opinion on question seven, and for question six I would have preferred that Shirt link to the specific policy that applied ([[WP:BIODEL]]). Not mentioning the policy gives me the suspicion that he might not have known it, although to be fair he did come to almost the same conclusion in his answer. However, despite my misgivings over the questions, I am well aware of the amount of good work Shirt has done for the project, and I think making him an admin would be a net positive for Wikipedia. — '''''"

Orlady,Binksternet,1,-1,2013,"21:34, 13 March 2013","'''Support'''. I seem to run across Binksternet rather often. I have seen him reverting vandalism and POV-pushing, ferreting out sockpuppets, engaging in talk-page discussions, creating new content, contributing to [[WP:DYK|DYK]], removing citations to non-[[WP:RS|RS]] sources, and communicating with users he's intersected with. In my judgement, he understands WP policy and guidelines, shows good judgment, and is thoughtful in his user communications (one example: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Salim_Dekkiche&oldid=539846571]). He's also consistently productive (where does he find the time?), which is an asset in a sysop. I believe his record over the last year indicates that he has internalized Wikipedia's rules of engagement and will not  repeat the behaviors that led to blocking in the past. I perceive that his work on articles about political topics is motivated by a desire to build and maintain a quality encyclopedia, and he is generally effective in doing so. Not all of us have his courage and fortitude to wade into controversial topics about which many people are passionate -- and about which most of his have opinions that we can't always disguise. IMO, the criticisms of his recent work that have been raised in the ""Oppose"" column should be chalked up to the logic that (1) these articles are minefields and (2) if you walk through minefields often enough, sooner or later a mine will explode in your face. People who are brave enough to walk through minefields should not be punished for making an occasional misstep. I believe he can be trusted with the broom and the mop -- and I predict that he will shoulder a good chunk of the admin workload. --"

First off, I am sorry that you are experiencing so much drama here. Nobody should have to go through that. I have read much of the above, and there are many editors I respect in the Support, Oppose, and Neutral columns. I can tell you're a great editor, and that you consistently try to do the right thing. I was looking at your block log and I'm impressed by the way you would agree to 1RR on certain pages, and that you've kept it clean for over a year now. I don't want to be so flippant as to say ""Come back in a year and I'll support"". (Easily said, hard to do.) However, I don't think it would hurt if you did take some time to work on improving in some of the areas where people have concerns. If you want my advice, I would say to do this: Privately and voluntarily commit to a strict 1RR restriction on ''all'' articles. (You don't have to put the template on your userpage or anything.) Reverting obvious vandalism is of course an exception. Don't revert twice ''even if you know you're right''. Always try to edit from a neutral point of view, and don't just edit when NPOV and your views happen to coincide. (I'm not saying you don't already do this...I just don't know you very well, and I'm trying to take into account the concerns of some of the opposition.) Wait for what you feel is a sufficient amount of time (it looks like many have recommended a year, I'd say at least half that) and then come back.

However, looking for the votes in this section, there seems to be several. The [[BP]] article and its talk page may be one example where this editor was involved in deep conflict in last December or just three months ago.

I found [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABP&diff=527977520&oldid=527977408 this comment] about copyright issues not encouraging to support nomination for adminship as this is quite fundamental issue for Wikipedia (it was previously described at the talk page in details why the text re-added by Binksternet violates [[WP:CV]] (copy-pasted direct quote without reference camouflaged by existing reference in the text which was not about the re-added text) but nevertheless this was ignored).

If I understand it correctly, the candidate proposed a change that would have altered the way a template uses parameters, thus breaking potentially thousands of transclusions. Such a change absolutely must be exactly compatible with the existing version, and it's a rookie mistake to break that. Secondly, you shouldn't propose such a change without demonstrating that you have tested it, and that's another rookie mistake. So while I see someone who is clearly technically clever, I also think I see a cavalier attitude to proper software development practice - and people who approach it like that should not be able to make changes without review.

So since I'm the first, I guess that means the burden's on me to lay out some solid reasoning. I took a moment to peruse through your contributions to the Wikipedia namespace. The only thing I was able to conclude is that you're something of a robot. Yes, you've done a lot of vandalism cleanup, and it appears that you also have some solid work in enhancing that field. But that is ''not'' what an administrator is. An administrator needs to be someone capable of making solid decisions, especially ones surrounded by controversy. What I don't see, and what I need to see to be able to support, or at least go neutral, is some understanding of policy. I just don't see it. Yes, I get that you don't intend to be floating around [[WP:DR]]. Yes, I get that you probably won't close any [[WP:AFD]]s. I don't expect any administrator to know every policy. I don't think there is any administrator here that does. But that doesn't mean you can be completely ignorant of those policies. Instead, what I saw in your Wikipedia namespace contributions was two things: a lack of substance, and a significant bias towards your anti-vandalism tool. Don't get me wrong, I'm a software engineer myself, and I know the amount of work a tool like that takes. I value this contribution a lot. But I keep going back to that is ''not'' what an administrator is. I fear that this RFA is really some form of a backdoor researcher user right, and if that's really what you're after, then we should find some way to fix that problem rather than, to use a software term, hack out a solution. This RFA to me feels just like that, a hack, and I cannot support it until I find some solid purpose for granting the right and evidence to support knowledge backing up that purpose. --"

I've looked over the candidates contributions to mainspace to see what there is in terms of addition of actual sourced content. There's very, very little, and what there is gives me pause for thought. The candidate's edits to his most-edited article are almost entirely formatting changes and similar tweaks. Of what he lists as his article creations, the highest ""rated"" is [[David Segal (reporter)]]. Apart from its creation 241 words long and just exactly long enough for DYK, the candidate's other major edits to it are things like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Segal_%28reporter%29&diff=519740659&oldid=519725538 this edit] where he adds a typepad.com blog and a piece by tabloid the ''Daily Mail'' as the sole sources for claims that a named living person ""bullied and threatened his customers"" and was convicted of fraud and jailed. (Those claims are still in the article now, the only additional source being one written by Segal himself.) These claims may well be true, but this is '''not''' how [[WP:BLP]] tells us to write about living persons. Aside from that, there may occasionally be times where a candidate lacking in content contributions clearly still has the thoughtful approach to content (and respect for others' contributions to the encyclopedia) that we expect serious long-term content contribution to develop. However, this is ''not'' one of those times, as the examples of careless and hasty tagging cited by others above have indicated. Someone with these issues should not be wielding the delete button. Finally, the script incident, from only around six months ago, still causes me serious concern. De-escalating the situation, Kudpung jokingly said to Theopolisme and Riley that running scripts against mainspace should be left to ""geniuses"". The candidate's response here - after plenty of time to consider the situation - is not that he's going to avoid running scripts, not that he's going to stop accepting scripts from other people over IRC to run himself in order to be ""helpful"", not that he won't run scripts with his admin account. Instead, all he says is that in future he's going to always know ""''exactly''"" what he's running. I'm sure that's more cautious than the approach he's taken before, but I'm really not sure it's enough. --"

Unfortunately, although TParis is being quite lenient, this answer and orientation is not acceptable at all. The first and foremost step is to engage the user in discussions. If a 3RR has been breached, even then extreme care has to be taken to engage the editor first or to confirm whether the editor has been substantially warned. Additionally, if Theo himself has initiated editing the said article and has started reverting deleted content, there is no definite guarantee that Theo is not seen as being involved by outside parties. In other words; consequently, his act of blocking the editor ''might'' be seen as being an involved act.

For years he's been helpful and supportive of others, and is far more valuable than the drones that run around mindlessly tagging stuff, running up edit counts without actually thinking about the implications of their so called contributions. I've disagreed with him a number of times, but he's always been ready to listen and consider the alternative viewpoint, discuss the differences and split the difference in a way leaving the matter... tasteworthy. No one ever is perfectly satisfied with a compromise, after all. Compromising with Piotr has been much better to swallow than most. His time investment in the project has been massive, he's been constant and always done his best for quality, however biased some may feel some things were twisted. Everyone has their politics, most are indoctrinated and puppets unaware of whose controlling their string. Piotr is not someone who could be duped that way. Wikipedia without people like Piotr would be a pale shadow of itself, not the reference of first resort it's become.

The amount of ""no need"" opposes is surprising, especially given how we've never had a shortage of mops to give out and how much complaining there is at the declining number of admins. Jason Quinn has been around for close to decade, has had a relatively stable edit rate for the past several years and his last RfA was over five years ago; I think he'd be a safe person to have as an administrator.

Also, the user explicitly says they need this for ~20 at the most views. I don't agree on promoting someone if they admit they're going to only use it 20 times before they either give it up or stop using it. Also again, the content of the copyvioed pages shouldn't be relavent, only that they were copyvioed, which has already been understood and affirmed by many who already have the right. Also, I have concerns about the user's civility and off-wiki actions (mainly the Prioryman question and others on similar sites). Fourthly, the Foundation has already expressed the lack of a legal ability for non-admins to view deleted pages, and this is the same thing. My suggestion to Carrite would be to contact a member of the Arbitration Committee privately and receive any text deemed necessary through that method, or otherwise recieve infromation from an arbitrator directly. This RfA should also be immediately closed as a request for the community to override the Foundation/Board decision that a non-admin should not have access to all deleted text for any reason at any time, without prejudice against a re-nomination for permanent adminship to include the tool in question."

The more experience you have on wikipedia the more likelihood you're going to encounter trouble, arguments and attract those who dislike you, which equates to more fodder for opposing, even if 99% of what they've done and said is great. It's become a battle ground for old grudges and disputes to resurface and a chance to make good editors feel dreadful for anything they've ever done on wikipedia less than perfect.

The bottom line is: every decent editor who specialises in anything but hard science, is going to make more enemies than friends. It's as simple as that, been there, done that. In history or social sciences (which seem to be the two main focuses of Piotrus' work here) there is no God-given truth. What one person writes about, say, WWII, another will question and yet another will call the original author names because of that.

I hope that the candidate will regard what I say as friendly feedback, because I'm saying it in that spirit. Obviously, anyone with this extensive a track record is a trustworthy contributor to the project. And I put a lot of faith in nominations by Mr. Strad. Nevertheless, I actually find a lot of substance in the much-maligned opposes. Is it a problem if someone who tends to follow the crowd closes AfDs? Actually, we kind of want admins to follow the consensus, rather than force a super-vote over consensus. And we absolutely should never disqualify an RfA candidate whose subject interests are disliked, so long as they are within the scope of what passes [[WP:NOT]]. But I kind of agree with DGG that we have too many low-quality fan-cruft pages about sports persons, and I want to make sure that closing admins will exert critical thinking instead of just following ""keep"" !votes. Does it matter if an admin is careless about grammar? Well, it's not a disqualifier, but put yourself in the shoes of a user who ended up on the losing side of an admin decision, and finds that decision explained with an obvious language error. It shakes confidence, and that undermines the project. So I have more sympathy for those editors who oppose the candidate, than the majority here appears to have. But I believe that the candidate will take this feedback constructively, and if he does, he'll probably do fine as an administrator. --"

You totally vetted out an RfA candidate, went over a significant sampling of their edits, read all the oppose and support rationales and did the homework to draw your own conclusions in a few minutes?

WP exists in a state where compromise is essential and no one solution is perfect, having content led administrators would be good for many things but not everything, so when good candidates come forward who will be a net positive to the project, even if they don't have a FA, GA, DYK and the triple crown, I feel we should support them and make use of the skills they offer the community."

Liangshan Yi,Bilby,-1,1,2013,"13:52, 28 May 2013","'''Oppose''' Bilby seems to be a very fine candidate in most respects. But Warden has highlighted a problem. On the [[Ugg boots trademark disputes]] article, there has been a series of Requests For Comment. The first one was closed improperly by an Australian problem editor who has been involved in repeated misconduct. The second one has an obvious meatpuppet case by another Australian editor described [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADpmuk&diff=555224192&oldid=555093685 here], and another possible case that is more subtle and much more damaging to Wikipedia described [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AUgg_boots_trademark_disputes&diff=553967503&oldid=553963004 here], also possibly involving several Australian editors. As I have said on the Talk page, it looks good but it smells bad. I think Bilby is a fine editor. He is the best Australian editor involved in that series of articles. But when the trouble started, he disappeared. Bilby has done nothing to counsel the problem editors from Australia and improve their behavior. Instead he has become their ally whenever they needed one. Therefore I am concerned that we are giving administrative powers to one side in a content dispute. I am also concerned that the first RFC was closed improperly, and the second may be closed improperly in a very similar way. Consensus should be determined by [[WP:CONSENSUS#Determining_consensus]]: ""Consensus is determined by the quality of the arguments given on the various sides of an issue, as viewed through the lens of Wikipedia policy."" The number of votes is not mentioned and should not matter. Also, in [[Wikipedia:Closing_discussions]]: ""Consensus is not determined by counting heads."" But the first RFC was closed by the Australian problem editor, by counting votes and ignoring policy arguments. The second time it was closed, the administrator admitted that one side had stronger policy arguments, but he allowed the larger number of votes on the other side to balance it, producing a ""no consensus"" result. This RFC needs greater participation by experienced editors who will rely on policy, not the number of votes. Bilby has voted on the side that has more votes and no policy arguments. Then he disappeared. This raises doubts about how he would use administrative tools if they are given to him. I regret I must oppose this nomination."

Hence I do not see any problem with giving him tools back. Finally, we have a serious problem with insufficient number of participants and admins, compare to the numbers of pages. This is because the plank for appointing someone an administrator is very high: we expect she/he be perfectly neutral and a good negotiator (few people have these qualities). However, very few administrators ''actually'' do negotiations or very active and decide important matters (e.g. on ANI or AE).

So no. (If the candidate wanted to concentrate in his areas of expertise, presumably copyright, Commons moves, Requested moves, then I think it is a big loss too, but it isn't his fault, since he has numerous years of proven stability, but the Admin tools are not broken up to give him what he needs in those areas. The candidate's responses to civility issues were shallow, but that squares with me as normal given no experience in contentious areas. And there is major lack of experience in content creation or building. I would not want to hand over the block button to the candidate under those circumstances unless either it was clear he was definitely not interested in going into areas like ANI and DELETION. We are losing a reliable hand here in the copyright and other areas, but that is not his fault, it is the fault that Admin tools are not broken up at all to support speciality areas, while keeping the block button and tools for other content-related areas separate and for other candidates with evidenced experience in the pertinent areas. [I'm not trying to open a thread here about why we don't separate the tools, but I am puzzled why WP hasn't made that logical move yet, and prefers to have these endless debates based on the same illogical point that 1) the Admin package includes all the tools, 2) an Admin candidate needs to be trusted in all the areas those tools apply, 3) it isn't realistic to expect a candidate to demonstrate trusted experience/knowledge in all those areas, and 4) that the candidate should re-apply to RfA after spending time boosting his experience/knowledge in those areas [even though the candidate may not have any interest in those areas -- which is like making someone eat ""peas"" when they may not like them].

Thus, someone's demeanor in a RfA should be considered putting his best foot forward, and that person's demeanor will by definition never be any better than it is during a RfA. I'm not saying that Kumioko's behavior here is poor, but the opening statement seems to indicate that Kumioko doesn't take this process seriously. Additionally, I find Kumioko's response to Q3 to be particularly concerning as it gives the appearance of dissembling and minimizing rather than taking responsibility of past problems.

While I get the impression of an editor who is quick to go about ""fixing"" things, I also see an editor that is (very) quick to revisit their own edits and admit to mistakes when called on.  The only real concern I noticed was a few discussions with Kudpung, and even there I perceived a ""due respect"" and willingness to listen.  While Theopolisme may not have the circumspection of a NYB (few do, myself included), they do remain calm and discuss things when asked.  In the end, while I may often want oppose due to ""maturity"" issues, I simply can't see this editor breaking anything that he wouldn't be immediately willing to fix if it was pointed out to him/her.  I see some good template work, consistent notification to other users when applying any editing that may concern them, and a lot of attention to minor fixes and improvements to references.

I gave it some thought however, and I still believe Jasper is a huge positive with the tools and I behind my decision of nominating him. Reaper Eternal oppose vote is partly correct, and like he said there is stuff I won't mention here being an off-wiki issue. It mostly regard this RFA however, which can prove this is not an OMG, I must get tools RFA. My experience with JD is a user who made a number of mistakes early on, but mainly because he was a rather enthusiastic newbie, which is quite common with vandal fighters, new page patrol, and so forth. But while most of those editors either burn out quick, or won't admit their mistakes, a select few starts to learn from their mistakes, learns how to have more patience and maturity, go and eventually they end up as some of our most respected editors in this project. Jasper Deng early actions reeks of the 2007 era in which that sort of crap was ignored by the community and most likely his first taste of administrative actions, vandal and new page patrolling and so forth comes from that era. Our discussion about this RFA convinced me that Jasper Deng is one of those editors, a person who matured drastically as he aged and got accustomed to the attitude changes throughout that time period. His technical ability shows someone who would further enhance the project if he gets the tool set, especially with IPv6, a subject that not many administrators are familiar with. His willingness to learn from his mistakes is something truly exceptional and if this doesn't succeed I know he would simply shrug this RFA and continue editing. I did saw the link RE gave about his ""aim"" of these tools, but that is a user subpage was formed rather early in his wikicareer (2011).

Examples can be found in the articles on [[Pro-life feminism]] where, until counter-evidence was demonstrated, he insisted that the article should retain a blanket statement saying that Irish pro-life feminists stayed out of the political issue of whether abortion should be legal; and in the article on [[Maafa 21]] where he wanted Wikipedia to flatly state that the film was factually ""wrong."""

A lot of Ymblanter's AfD comments sound like the arguments given at [[WP:ITSNOTABLE]], which is not a desirable trait to have in an admin who is going to be closing AfD discussions. However, after looking at the big picture of his AfD contributions I could find plenty of counterexamples that demonstrate that he does know what is required by the notability guidelines. (For example, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/GEAR_Video&diff=532572010&oldid=532455217][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Abdur_Razzaq_%28barrister%29&diff=536166160&oldid=536114171][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Calvin_Jung&diff=536164958&oldid=536133887].)

I also note [[Wikipedia:Featured article review/Polish–Soviet War/archive1]] from late 2011 in which Piotrus initially argued in favour of keeping this FA despite it suffering from some major, and fairly obvious, problems (though I note that he agreed with me when I pointed these out towards the end of the FAR in February 2012).

The populist politics are concerning, but not all that trouble me about this candidate. I like to see significant content contributions from admins. Some like to see FAs or GAs. I personally think FA/GA can be more about proper formatting rather than writing a comprehensive encyclopedia article, but it usually shows how one responds to criticism. FA/GA at RfA ''should'' be about two things: showing that actual writing of the encyclopedia is a top priority and showing collaboration with other users. The FA/GAs appear to have been written out of a desire to pass RfA (and subsequent Arbcom). Further, they were written entirely by Lord Roem and show no collaboration with others. The topics were simply not interesting enough for anyone else to even start a stub on the topic.[http://toolserver.org/~daniel/WikiSense/Contributors.php?wikilang=en&wikifam=.wikipedia.org&grouped=on&page=Taylor_v._Illinois] In [[Taylor v.

One of the references (Stocker) is used only once, one (Atkinson) is used 12 times, and the third (Heiderscheit) is used 5 times. Basically, this ""good"" article is based on one source. But there are so many <nowiki><ref></nowiki> tags thrown in there it appears as if the article is well sourced. This isn't to say the article is not needed on Wikipedia, but it does show that you are more interested in ticking off the boxes needed to make a Good Article rather than writing a good article.

You created 5 stubs and didn't do more than one or two edits to them (one probably needs to be at AFD [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covin_(automobile)]), The most you have spend on any user talk page is 10 edits, most of them were only one edit.  I see only 12 months of sporatic ''real'' contributions, it just took 9 years to get that.  The most edits to one article is 17.  #10 in that list is 8 edits.  Your #10 top talk page is 3 edits, meaning you don't talk on article pages much at all.  Same with user talk.  In short, I simply have NO idea what kind of admin you would be.  I'm sure you wouldn't intentionally do anything bad, no doubt, but with literally no experience in extended discussions in any venue, I have no evidence you will see a problem through, can deal with a heated content dispute, or determine consensus.  The overly simplified answer to #5 also worries me that you would be too quick to block for minor rudeness, not out of meanness, but out of not understanding the nuances of the policy. Don't get me wrong, I think gnomes are the unsung heros at Wikipedia and I think you are a good one, but I can't support adminship."

However, the lack of experience is clear, and recent activity has majored heavily on putting templates (welcome and vandalism) on user talk pages, which anyone can do. I'm also concerned at the habit of popping up at users' talk pages with unsolicited advice. The one linked above, at [[User talk:LittleBenW#WP:AN notice]], was a significant misjudgement, in my view. The inital posting of the new ''Recent activity'' section, before LittleBen had replied to the AN notification, could have been an oversight, but the follow-up just ten minutes after LittleBen's reply (indicating that he considered that he was being got at) was less likely to pour oil on troubled waters than to add fuel to the fire. It's very unwise to try to tell people how to feel, and unsolicited advice in emotionally fraught situations can easily come across as interfering.

Whenever he offers rationale at XfD, his arguments are always based on policy, not arbitrary opinion. The reason I'm neutral, however, is because I'm wary of the [[WP:LAWYER|lawyering]] at which he is so adept. On numerous occasions I have seen rebuttals in XfD's or talk page discussions where it appears as though he thinks by adding longer responses and/or driving home more secondary points, the opposing viewpoint editors will either give up out of exhaustion trying to answer every detail he demands or become too confused by the long-winded responses to adequately rebut. For him as an admin, I just fear that too many discussions would be bogged down by expansive paragraphs of Wiki-jargon; 99.9% of us editors don't have juris doctors, so debating with Dirtlawyer1 already puts the rest of us behind the 8-ball to begin with.

I've run into Theopolisme a few times and had a general positive impression that was enforced by Dennis Brown's strong nomination statement. The user is an asset to the project as a vandalism fighter and would become more of an asset with access to the sysop tools. He is consistently pleasant in his communications with other users. Delving into his contributions, I formed an overall impression of an earnest and sincere young man who has put a lot of effort into building his Wikipedia resume in order to qualify for adminship. Therein lies a concern -- in his article creations and his participation on nomination discussions for his DYKs, he shows a very limited acquaintance with content-related policies/guidelines and the principles behind them. While an administrator can elect to stay away from matters they don't understand very well -- and I fully expect that he would elect to stay away from most matters related to topics like notability, verifiability, etc., there's a general expectation that administrators understand policy and can make good judgements about policies they aren't thoroughly familiar with. Due to this user's apparent youth -- and lack of life experience -- he falls short of that general expectation. Still, I was in the neutral column but leaning toward support until seeing relatively recent instances of what I consider to be too-hasty and/or ill-conceived new-page patroller taggings: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Methodist_churches&oldid=523928013 this prod notice added one minute after the article was created], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aziz_Abdullah_Ahmed&diff=539534371&oldid=539534017 this speedy-delete-as-hoax tag] cited earlier in this discussion.

Arguably, I think anyone will agree that everyone started Wikipedia at some point and may have gone on to make valuable contributions, but that has been after a fair length of time, having made many mistakes, and having done a lot of learning in the process. Adminship is access to a set of tools where you have knowledge of how to appropriately apply them. The second concern for me was that this editor wanted to 'try' the tools before deciding where their interests lie. I would feel more comfortable if the editor learned more about the areas where the tools are used before asking for the ability to administer them. The answers to questions 1, 2 and 6 were troubling. On another note, I am somewhat horrified that this editor is being persecuted for accusations regarding their beliefs!"

But, on close inspection, that article was started by someone else and the candidate just expanded it.  Looking at the contributions for last October, I notice the creation of [[List of breweries in Idaho]].  This seems quite weak in that none of the entries are blue-links and the source is quite promotional in tone (""Visit Idaho"").  And, as the candidate is quite proficient with redirects, it's surprising that he didn't go on to create redirects for the distinctive brewery names like [[Laughing Dog Brewery]].  As the candidate is a librarian, I would have expected them to do a better job by turning up sources like ''Beer and Brewing in the Inland Northwest, 1850 to 1950'' or ''Great American Craft Beer''.
