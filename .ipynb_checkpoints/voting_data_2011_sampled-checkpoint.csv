Everyone, including admins, can make mistakes and sometimes get drawn into issues they should preferably have stayed clear of, but insisting that sysops be infallible reinforces the idea the adminship is indeed 'a big deal' and a very big one too. It ain't - it's actually a mug's game, but someone has to do it, and Sarek does it rather well."

Editor displays poor judgement; aside from coming here instead of Administrator review - unless many users are calling for your head, that is the appropriate place, - using admin tools in situations where admin was clearly involved. If it were in relation to ''blatant and obvious vandalism'' that would be one thing, but this has also been done in content dispute where seeking an uninvolved admin would have been the appropriate action. The issue of WP:INVOLVED was touched on when the editor did go through admin review but SarekOfVulcan does not appear to have taken heed of that. I am also concerned with civility displayed; To me it appears the user has taken to this RfA with a bit of a cocky attitude and I concur with Sven Manguard that first timer would have been hung out if responding to questions as this user did, regardless of the reasons.

Ironholds doesn't make any more mistakes than any reasonable admin does patrolling CAT:CSD. And ""mistakes"" there are inevitable due to the high rate of articles that enter CAT:CSD and the low number of admins who have to trawl through it. The sad fact is that the easiest way to pass AfD as a ""deletion"" candidate is to play CSD-tagging very very conservatively for two-three months to make your stats look famous. Ironholds shouldn't be disadvantaged for his unwillingness to [[WP:GAME|game]] in that way.

I do want to comment on [[WP:HUMAN]] though. With the exception of a few dozen paid staff at the WMF, all the WMF projects, including enwp, are run by volunteers. For the most part, we volunteers do this out of the goodness of our heart. As volunteers we expect to be appreciated and treated with respect. Volunteers that are mistreated are likely to leave the project whether they are registered users or IPs. We've been losing registered members continuously for several years and it's enough of a concern that the WMF has made it a priority to increase our registered user base. All future registered users will come from this pool of IPs. They are a valuable and essential resource for our project. Having admins that understand this is a great benefit to the project and I applaud RA for writing [[WP:HUMAN]]. I look forward to RA's future contributions and hope RA will spend some amount of time interacting with the IPs that edit here and hopefully turn them in to long-term contributors. - '''''"

Sandy's argument, while in places persuasive, has been blown out of proportion IMO. Two of her points I disagree with (one has since been stricken, the other I objected to in the conversation below), and a further two were not the doing of the candidate, which just leaves experience. Mkativerata makes an argument about the sloppy selection of DYKs, which has merit. Without wishing to completely excuse The Bushranger (because the CV should have been spotted), at the moment the stage of taking accepted hooks to the prep stage is procedural. The initial authors, reviewers, and most relevantly admin(s) who actually put those articles onto the main page are also culpable. In summary I share Mkativerata's sentiment that admins need to take a lot more responsibility at DYK, and that the argument constitutes solid grounds to oppose. But I believe that once bitten will be twice shy, that given the weight of the backlash here, some fundamental change at DYK is on the way, and as far as I have seen The Bushranger has not used sources that cannot be reasonably argued as reliable. —"

The notability subguideline issue in q6 is the only one that I think is anything close to ""wrong"". The rollback/revert conflation in q7 has been adequately explained by the candidate. DGG's identification of question 9 as a problem is puzzling for me. I think the answer is fine. I'm comfortable with giving the candidate a broad set of admin tools. Any concerns I'd have about narrow experience were hit out of the park by some of the answers to questions. Those answers include the answers to questions 12-15 which show unusual knowledge of, and likely competence in, an area in which the candidate doesn't appear to have been active at all. Other answers are also good. I accept the candidate's explanation for the sourcing of the Richardson article -- see the response to SandyGeorgia's oppose -- inconsistent with best practice as it is. The positives for me include a demonstrated willingness to work backlogs. Working backlogs generally involve the least controversial use of tools. I think the candidate is sufficiently experienced, qualified and capable, as demonstrated by the record and responses to questions and concerns in this RfA.--"

Snottywong did a nice job addressing the questions on this page. If those answers were all I had to go on, I'd be heartily in favor of making him an admin -- he's clearly smart, he's familiar with policies and processes, he's willing to help out, and we need more admins to pick up the workload. In my past interactions with him, which I remember him because of that username of his, I've found him at different times to be an annoyingly doctrinaire deletionist, a reasonable guy who admits his errors and goes out of his way to be civil, and even an inexplicably impassioned defender of inclusion (this was at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Masonic buildings]]). Although my personal interactions with him have been civil, it's clear that this is not everyone's experience –  it seems that Snottywong has a temper.  I'm concerned by his expressed hostility to the ARS and his filing of that RfC for Colonel Warden. As others have said, that behavior suggests a lack of maturity. I have experienced some hard-nosed deletionism on his part (for example, when we interacted at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Heartland Baptist Bible College]], he declared that the article should be deleted as an ""unaccredited school which cannot grant academic degrees"", leading me to wonder if he thinks that Wikipedia articles are supposed to be certificates of legitimacy, kind of like the [[Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval]]).  Seeing his deletionism, I looked at his article-edit count, because I think that people who delete articles ought to have sufficient article-building experience to give them empathy with the people who have put their hearts into article development. His low article-space edit count doesn't give me confidence that he has that empathy.  I want to say that he'll do fine if he's handed the mop, but I can't, because there are too many things that make me think that this could be a big mistake. --"

When I say disregard, I'm not talking about occasional mistakes and lapses; I am talking about actions and comments which are made with a view that he should be allowed to make them because he has the privileges to do so. I'm not willing to elect on that condition. Sometimes admins are given feedback and asked to modify the way they act, and where they cannot or will not do so, are advised to avoid certain areas/actions/comments (eg; this candidate refers to an admin by the name of Sandstein above; recently, that admin was counselled and advised by AC in relation to a specific area [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARisker&action=historysubmit&diff=426850392&oldid=426785463]). But where an admin puts his own views ahead of the feedback and is unwilling or unable to avoid those areas/actions/comments, we prevent the problem from arising again. Policy is not just a statement for non-Wikipedians to understand how this project works; it exists to protect the project and hold users accountable where necessary too. Likewise, the protections that policy holds for admins (such as some of the involved provisions) are not to be relied upon as wikilawyering material when taking an action; '''those policy protections are for situations where genuine accidents and rare slight lapses have occurred; it's a matter of circumstances. When an admin knowingly goes out of his way to do something more than just questionable (because he has the privileges to do so), that is NOT ok.''' Also, admins should not set or follow poor examples, and it is unhelpful to the project to unnecessarily escalate/inflame disputes. The candidate's response for making blocks where he may be involved is that it is time-sensitive and that it will become stale by the time he reports it; in that case, is action absolutely necessary at the point at which he takes it or is DR more appropriate given his position? Privileges were given to use with good judgement both for the benefit of the project and in accordance with standards/expectations; that does not include toeing the line in terms of misuse and enforcing personal views ahead of the expectations of the Community. Sadly, what I asked in my support vote in 2008 seems to have been ignored by him, much like some other genuine concerns expressed by others, as of late."

Some of the other questions, in my opinion, really needed ""''It depends - if x, then I'd do one thing, but if y, I'd do something else''"" answers - some of the questions do not have fixed ""correct"" answers in my opinion, and I'd really want to see a bit more reasoning and explanation rather than just an attempt at a straight answer.

What finally convinced me not to support was the communication issue mentioned by many participants: Not every question requires a 200-words response, not every RfA !vote invites you to hit the ""edit"" button, and eventually, you do not need to show off your rich vocabulary in everything you write here. Some of your analyses come across as kafkaesque at best, and as pompous and obfuscated at worst. Cheers,"

Clearly a good editor on most levels, and might well be a good admin in the future, but right now I have too many concerns to ignore. The edits linked in Q3 are troublesome, basically per Snottywong (although I'm impressed that the issue was brought up voluntarily). I'm also disappointed by the creation of two [[WXM87|unsourced]] [[WXL71|articles]] less than a month ago - verifiability is a fundamental policy that administrators should be able to understand and implement correctly. Given that we have fairly few recent edits to judge (only 430 since May), I would have liked to see much more consistency.

He frequently goes to some effort to explain things to inexperienced users, rather than just throwing a boilerplate warning at them, and looking through his editing history I have found that he regularly patiently explains things in a courteous and constructive way to editors who have created problems. These are characteristics which are of great importance in an administrator. Is he perfect? No, of course not, and Kudpung himself admits in referring to the ANI case he mentions above that he ""didn’t handle it too well"". However, we all make mistakes sometimes, and the fact that he is able and willing to acknowledge his mistake is a strong point in his favour. That incident was a year ago, and I have not found anything similar more recently. The ability to learn and improve is good. In any case, he merely ""didn’t handle it too well"", rather than ""completely mishandled it"". There are people with far worse incidents in their history who have gone on to become excellent administrators. Do I always agree with Kudpung? No, there have been times when I have disagreed quite strongly with him. However, that is no bar to supporting: there is room for administrators with a wide range of points of view. Kudpung is perfectly right in believing that the admin tools would be helpful to him in the course of the sort of work he regularly does.

Monty845,Dudemanfellabra,0,-1,2011,"16:19, 4 July 2011","'''Neutral''' First, I don't think the paraphrasing issue should be decisive here; for me what is really important is that a candidate for admin have competency in the area(s) they want to work in, and that they seem unlikely to misuse the tools in the case of a conflict. The desire to work on protected templates is a good reason to request admin, and on that alone I would support. However, in light of the candidate's stated intention to work with speedy deletions and lack of history in the area, I felt it was necessary to ask questions designed to probe the candidate's knowledge of deletion process. While the answers to the questions have shown a positive content creation outlook and a desire to work constructively with others, they have not demonstrated an understanding of speedy deletion process. Deleting the article under A7 if you can't improve it could be argued to be a correct outcome, but the candidate has not identified the relevant issues to consider or explained why they result in deletion(note I personally think the article passes A7 and that if it is to be deleted it should be deleted under an alternative process). Because of the lack of review or discussion that occurs in most CSD applications, I cannot support a candidate who intends to work in the field but has not demonstrated a clear understanding of process."

On the other hand, I can legitimately support, because SnottyWong has gotten so much better (from my perspective) since our first interactions.  For those of you not familiar with the history, suffice it to say that in mid-2010, SnottyWong and I had an altercation surrounding a number of rescue-tagged AfDs which ended up with an MfD for one of his userboxes and RfC filed against me, both of which were inconclusive.  We've since put those differences behind us and been collaborating on a number of issues, including discussions about the possibilities of SnottyWong serving as an administrator.</p><p>I continue to have some concerns about his views on deletionism, most recently with the AfD for [[Surfer hair]], where I think his !vote tended to focus on the trees—notability contribution of individual sources—instead of the forest—the fact that the article, as improved, read as well or better than many other Wikipedia articles and covered a topic whose inclusion a man-on-the-street would find comprehensible.</p><p>Still, taking a forest vs. trees view myself, I see a marked improvement over the past year, and have solidly changed my mind, being now solidly convinced that SnottyWong is here to build the encyclopedia.  He has done some bang-up content work, participated more broadly in various areas including [[WP:3O]] and GA reviews, and has moderated his participation in AfDs.</p><p>Ultimately, I am not particularly surprised by the results here.  I grant that others may not see the evolution I have seen, and given the battlefield history, I can no more fault them for opposing SnottyWong than I can for folks opposing my own ArbCom election.  In each case, good editors need to make decisions about whether the editor in question has learned from past mistakes.  The bottom line for my '''support''' is that I believe that such is the case in SnottyWong's Wikipedia career."

JamesBWatson,Cprice1000,-1,-1,2011,"21:46, 1 January 2011","Unfortunately no. The candidate is keen and enthusiastic, and it's a pity to be discouraging, but alas it has to be so. Cprice1000 expresses an intention to work at AIV, but I can find scarcely any evidence of anti-vandal work at all, and ''the one and only contribution the candidate has ever made to AIV'' was an inappropriate one, involving an IP with very few edits and only one within the last month. We do not need admins starting to take actions at AIV without experience of how it works. Nor do I see much evidence of other work relating to admin issues. The candidate's work on Wikipedia is largely limited to one very narrowly limited topic, and does not suggest an all-round knowledge of how Wikipedia works. The candidate has a history of posting messages asking for participation in discussions, in a way that looks very much like [[WP:CANVASS|canvassing]]. This has even happened in connection with this RfA, as can be seen in the following edits:[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Blackjacks101&diff=prev&oldid=405281498], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Candyo32&diff=prev&oldid=405281557], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lil-unique1&diff=prev&oldid=405281672], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jivesh_boodhun&diff=prev&oldid=405281721], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Legolas2186&diff=prev&oldid=405281793]. Perhaps it wasn't canvassing, but it looks that way. Anyone who has so little awareness of Wikipedia standards that they don't realise that even the appearance of canvassing is likely to count against them cannot be suitable to be an administrator. (If it actually was canvassing, then there is absolutely no question of adminship, but I am willing to assume it wasn't.)"

I like administrators who have been involved in disputes instead of simply avoiding them. Reverting vandalism without warnings. If you're going to label an edit as vandalism, please warn the user on their talk page. Then if they continue the vandalism they can be blocked sooner. Uploading public domain images to en not commons.

Steven's attempts to deceive others in order to cover his own ass, in particular, are problematic enough to prevent me from supporting his candidacy. Anyone familiar with the arbitration process knows that it's quite difficult to remove administrators who won't cop to their transgressions. As such, it strikes me as unwise to promote a candidate who has enjoyed a bit of notoriety for being unwilling to own up to his own mistakes."

Alpha Quadrant,Neelix,-1,1,2011,"19:08, 2 March 2011","'''Oppose''' - Neelix appears to be very active in the article namespace. However there are a few things that concern me. Firstly he doesn't appear to have demonstrated understanding of the CSD policy. Particularly in question 15. Deleting an article under CSD is not about agreeing or disagreeing with the tagger. It is about being able to determine whether or not the article meets the CSD criteria. Question 4 is also concerning as it demonstrates lack of understanding of the blocking policy. Per the blocking policy, if a registered account is a disruption/vandalism only account it should be blocked indefinitely. Question 5 evades much of the question, as he said he would consult another admin. However, as an administrator primary working with content they should generally know how to handle a possible [[WP:COI|Conflicting Interest]] issue. If the article contained screenshots from a film still under production it is quite likely the author is working for the film company. With these issues I am quite concerned about how Neelix will handle administrative work outside of requested moves."

As for right now, concerns have been raised over CSD. I don't wish to pile on too much in that area, but one that I've seen that I'll add is [[User talk:216.106.111.142|this one]] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A216.106.111.142&action=historysubmit&diff=394084646&oldid=394084625 diff]), which in my view can only be explained by not being completely familiar with the criteria. AfD participation is on the thin side, although in fairness is insightful on the whole. You have a strong copyediting record combined with a couple of well developed articles, but as far as I can tell you haven't taken anything through a collaborative environment (I've seen a [[Wikipedia:Peer review/Vladimir Teplyakov/archive1|peer review]] and a [[Talk:Vladimir Teplyakov/GA1|good article nomination]], but you didn't interact in either). On balance, I think you would benefit by waiting a little, and working on getting one or two GAs through (March is a great month, as there's a backlog drive), CSD accuracy, and more of the same at AfD.

To now support is what I have decided to do, and I'll explain why: the PeterSymonds/Coffee account sharing and incident happened well over three years ago...more than long enough for someone to learn, mature and rebuild their trust, as Steven Zhang has done. That error notwithstanding, Steven Zhang is a highly experienced editor, and could quite easily have abandoned his account after the news broke, created a new account, and returned to adminship a few months later without anyone knowing. Instead, he has stuck with his original account, been honest, and worked hard to restore his image...a fair more difficult undertaking. I have been familiar (at least in observations, as I don't recall ever interacting with him) with Steven Zhang long before the sharing was revealed, and based on everything I know I do not believe he would be a bad admin; and nor do I think he would share his own admin account with anyone else (this assuming, of course, that this RfA is successful), thus creating a similar scenario to what happened years ago. He is constantly doing good work in the places where he chooses to edit, and there are no faults that I'm aware of. Finally, I have confidence in both the nominators, and know that Pedro and Doug would never have nominated if they thought that Steven Zhang would make a similar error to the one three years ago.

(I disagree with the ""oppose because of insufficient contributions"" thread on this page.) However, there is a serious lack of involvement in areas which are relevant to administrative tasks. There are plenty of good, hard-working editors who unfortunately simply misunderstand policies on deletion, vandalism, and so on. Unless you have experience in these areas, showing understanding of such matters, we have no way of knowing whether you are likely to make mistakes. Furthermore, your response to question 5 seems to indicate that you have a far too simplistic view of this issue, without even being aware that it is an issue. For example, understanding the speedy deletion criteria is a major issue, and assessing them in particular cases often requires a good deal of thought and care. Anyone who is not aware of that fact is not ready to be an administrator, especially if they have indicated that this is an area they expect to work in. You are doing a good job where you are, and you don't need to be an admin to continue to do those things you are good at."

The furore over Sarek saying he ""wouldn't object to an early closure"" is a storm in a teacup, and doesn't reflect on Sarek's competency as an admin. Any admin who makes it their policy to make tough block decisions is going to generate a hefty amount of opposition at a reconfirmation RfA. That Sarek knew this and went ahead anyway, clearly demonstrates that he values the community's opinions on his behaviour, more than he values his adminship. I think that's an indication that he can be trusted. In addition, although his way of saying it clearly doesn't satisfy a substantial minority of !voters, he obviously does take the concerns expressed seriously, and I think has learned from them. An addition - in my view a number of Opposes should be disregarded as they specifically state they are Opposed ''solely'' because this is a reconfirmation RfA; that's a groundless Oppose when this RfA clearly serves a very valid purpose. --"

But perhaps that's why I've used it (apart from the fact that I hope this support would 'technically' ensure that Tom's RfA doesn't fall into the grey area). Irrespective, so that the closing crat considers this candidacy in the right perspective, I'll give my views on a few of the oppose !votes and comments. I'm actually in consonance with oppose comments like those left by Sarek and Jim (and those who've referred to them or mirrored their view to give their views; that is, Swarm, Itszippy, Skater, Tofut, Epbr,John Malleus, Alessandro, Snotty...); a prospective admin needs to have his civil sense pristine and crystal clear, and the diffs do provide quite some evidence to the contrary. I add to it Tom's view that ""our civility policy is an extremely wordy extension of universal reciprocity: you should try to treat all editors in a way that that you would like to be treated."" Viewed literally, this interpretation should be unacceptable to a prospective admin. I've seen some atypical 'tough nut' editors using this very concept of universal reciprocity to challenge other editors, commenting that as they themselves are perfectly alright receiving personal attacks from other editors, they find it alright to give it off to others in the same coin. I'd rather expect an editor to treat all others in a way ""others would like to be treated"" rather than in a way the editor himself should like to be treated. That's where our civility policy marches ahead. I do hope Tom understands these quite important requirements from an administrator. Or perhaps he already does and I've read too much into his reply. At the same time, Tom's acceptance of his mistake in his reply to Jim does give quite some credence to Tom's intent to improve, despite Malleus' valid 'best-behavior during RfA' point. ''I hope Tom stands up when this RfA closes and gives a strong closing statement to the community that he'll ensure that as an admin, he'll attempt to be a model editor on the civility front''. It'll go a long way in assuaging the worry that even some of us supporters might entertain. It'll also ensure that Tom has a benchmark statement that he'll personally feel motivated to stand up to. Of course, I leave it to him to decide on that. Before I end this tardily elongated and backhanded support, I have to mention that some of the opposes are not quite acceptable in my view. Samir's view of Tom's inexperience in content is mislaid - in as much as while on one hand Tom does have considerable content experience, on the other, heavy duty content experience is also not required of admins. Intoronto's ""some concerns are raised"" is quite open ended and indefinite. NWA Rep's oppose seems utterly illogical (""self nom implying power hunger""). So in all, this is my technical support for Tom."

As shown by other commenters on this section, Fae seems to resort to speedy deletion a little ''too'' speedily; in many cases, nominating articles for CSD which have only just been created and barely had a chance to be improved. I agree that this creates concerns with [[WP:BITE]]: having articles nominated for speedy deletion within minutes of their creation is, I believe, one of the main issues that discourages new users from Wikipedia. Fae is currently on course to pass this RFA, but if he does, I hope he will bear these concerns in mind, and take the time to consider a CSD candidate carefully before deleting it, to make sure it really does fall within the criteria; and in particular, to make sure that new articles get at least a chance to be developed before being deleted."

Cases in point: For Q2, you give us a link to a list of articles and expect us to sort though them. That's great, and that could be part of your answer, but it tells us almost nothing and puts the onus on us to do the work of figuring out what your best contributions are. Some of those articles are better than others, a few are redlinks, and most of them were probably worked on after you started them. Ergo, your answer tells me almost nothing. For Q5, you respond to a question on BLP by showing a few minor edits off, some of which are routine vandalism fighting, and from that extrapolate that you have an understanding of BLP. I'm sorry, but that's not what we're looking for. We're looking for a coherent explanation as to we should trust that you understand BLP policy. Links can be part of it, but not all of it. In Q3 you are asked about conflicts, and how you would respond to them. Again you link us to other pages as opposed to answering the question.

I do however, completely disagree with the idea that edit summaries are somehow mandatory (they're not, and never will be). Edits which are housekeeping or for which the reasons are obvious don't require an edit summary. Edit summaries are simply there for those too lazy to look at the diff for the change themselves, or the change is something substantial which might not be obvious. Of course, edit summaries can just have anything written in them, so they are unreliable too. We have talk pages to discuss edits, and we certainly shouldn't be explaining our edits in the history.

I doubt you'd abuse the privilege of adminship were it granted to you, but I think it would be best if you held off on requesting for it until you've become more integrated into the Wikipedia community and have gained more experience in administrative areas (eg. [[WP:AFD|deletion discussions]], [[WP:VAND|anti-vandalism]], etc).

I think that admin's should only out right delete items that are nominated by other users G10,G12, or other libelous content under the file tags of CSD's since this is where they claim to be working, that they themselves find.

Some examples: unfortunately, while we can all ''guess'' what was meant by mention of Feezo's RFA, the reality is that the newbie user would be far less likely to be able to translate that comment, so I consider that something that might harm the project. (I'd sit this out otherwise; I don't like to even appear to pile on unless I think there is a real chance of problems.) There are also misspellings (""administrator"" misspelled three ''different'' ways, for example)...referring to blocked users as vandals in a blanket fashion (not all blocks are for vandalism)...lack of demonstrated communication regarding unblock requests (you don't need to be an admin to see and respond to unblock requests, even if you shouldn't actually ''decide'' an unblock request)...grammar errors in conversations on this page...they all add up.

ThatPeskyCommoner,Steven Zhang,1,-1,2011,"08:54, 6 November 2011","'''Support''' One of the things I most admire in Steven is his openness and honesty in dealing with the (ages-old) incident.  It would have been extremely easy for him simply to have resigned from that account, created another one under another name, and just come back as someone else.  In which case, nobody, as far as I can see, would have had any qualms on giving him a mop now.  The fact that his honesty about the earlier incident is effectively now used against him makes me uncomfortable.  We're all human, we all make mistakes (particularly in our over-zealous and impatient youth), and many of us can regret those mistakes, be honest about them, and turn over a completely new leaf.  This is what Steven has done.  The Steven of now has excellent interaction skills with other users, even difficult ones, and has shown superb judgment in (particularly) the Abortion debate.  His work there was quite brilliant, and an example to us all in terms of patience and insight with a very tricky situation.  His tagging is acceptably accurate and trustworthy, and he works hard, and well, and consistently.  If he had been a new editor in the latter part of 2009, with the record he has made since then, nobody would be likely to oppose this at all.  I strongly feel that it is very wrong for us to hold years'-old sins against people.  People do grow; people do change.  We need to accept this, and to move on, as Steven clearly has done. I don't think that there is the remotest possibility that, having worked so hard and well since then, he would abuse the mop. Time to say yes. Just adding (and I hope Steven can forgive me!)

We have too many problems with admins flirting with the boundaries of NOT INVOLVED. We need to move way, way, in the direction of stronger enforcement of it--there are 700 admins, and there is almost never need for one particular admin to take an action.  I cannot see that we can possibly have an active admin who intends to act totally opposed to Wikipedia policy about something important, and whose nearest approach to conformity is that he intends to  bring questionable blocks to the noticeboard more often, not that he intends to not make questionable blocks in the first place. As a subsidiary point, I would consider such an answer to be the height of arrogance, except that the following q,6 & 7, outdoes it. (even though I  agree with the actions he did take there, there were many perfectly good answers to give that would have said things politely).   Nobody who gave anywhere near the answers being given would have been confirmed in the first place.  This sort of unconcern is sometimes present in new admins, and I made one or two questionable calls myself in my first few months. The community explained things clearly to me & I've therefore learned to stay in the other direction. Many others have done similarly at first, and learned from it;  I wish SoV would do so also. But instead,  I interpret his   coming here as  realizing that  he has been working in a way that is questionable, and wanting us to endorse it. I would have liked to be able to interpret this as his way of saying publicly he has realized the problem and changed his position, and am willing to reconsider my  vote here accordingly.    '''"

I applaud your work with adoption/mentoring and your GA's/DYK's, but that work doesn't require adminship.  I feel this RfA is a bit premature and I'm not seeing a need for the bit at this point.  But it looks like you'll probably pass, and if you do I wish you the best of luck."

The community has decided that non-administrators are competent and allowed to close specific [[WP:AfD]] discussions. This admin candidate has added another policy of her own to the process: that ""it is a responsibility that would be best lying with the admins.""  The existing policy and an accompanying essay offer guidelines already that show that in many cases non-admin closures of AfDs are fine. This concerns me that the admin candidate intends to proceed in areas where she appears to have not read the policy/guidelines fully, leading to her establishing a bar for non-admin closures without full understanding that non-admin closures are for non-complex AfDs. She has taken a stance against non-admin closures, she raised the issue, she could have familiarized herself with the policy before answering the question. <blockquote>The only reason I've not closed one before is because I feel that it is a responsibility that would be best lying with the admins, simply because some cases can be quite complex.</blockquote> I am concerned that an admin candidates does not support community consensus and/or has not fully familiarized herself with the policies before answering the question, in addition to appearing to diminish the abilities of non-admins without reason (the policy and the accompanying essay already deal with complexity). Whether it arose that way or not, the complexity clause is a responsibility issue, not an IQ issue. --"

I have no problems with an admin who is primarily a vandal fighter rather than a content creator, as I feel it's appropriate to have all sorts of people with different skills, experience and interest as admins. However, I do have a problem with people who mislead, however unintentionally, as then I can't trust them. The candidate has given the impression that they have been ""polishing"" articles, and that they try to ""tighten up the writing"", and they are ""collaborating with other writers to produce a better product"", and to support that they state they are a professional writer. Yet when asked which articles they are proud of, they list articles to which they added nothing at all. They did not correct spelling even. They simply reverted. One article in the list they only made one (revert) edit. And another article, [[Democratic National Convention]], they haven't edited at all under the name Dayewalker. It may be that the candidate doesn't understand what ""good content work"" means (they don't seem to know the difference between nominator and candidate, as they have made a statement - ""Further Comment From The Nom""); though if it was the case that they are misunderstanding certain terms and phrases, then I wouldn't feel comfortable supporting as they would struggle with basic Wiki communication and would likely make too many mistakes. People who are clear and straightforward, and with whom communication has few misunderstandings make the best admins. It may be that Dayewalker feels under pressure from the comments of the lack of content work and so is now digging a hole for themselves. No worries.

This does ''not'' mean I think the problems will recur, but I  would prefer to  be more sure of it. There's another test I am reluctant to mention because its more a matter of feel: and that is the eagerness for return of privileges--especially when the privileges are not necessary for the   work currently being successfully engaged in.

He is still far away from wiki adminiship because he has quite often misconstrued or misinterpreted wiki's important policies and guidelines, particularly the most important the NPOV one. The maybe-well-known-disputed page [[Senkaku Islands]] and its relative pages was led to a mediation recently for its name/title dispute and debate. Based on the spirit, policies, and guidelines of Wikipedia, I raised that ""[[Wikipedia talk:Requests for mediation/Senkaku Islands#Wikipedia shall not be forced to take side when involving international territory dispute|Wikipedia shall not be forced to take side when involving international territory dispute]]"". His answer was ""Of course Wikipedia takes sides"".

The naming disputes over the page [[Senkaku Islands]] and its relative pages have lasted so long (a couple years) and Qwyrxian has actively played an important role there.

As for his such atitude towards wiki's NPOV, I am afraid if Qwyrxian is empowered with adminiship, he may make Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, becoming, at least in some parts or aspects, the pro-Japan or pro-whateverbiased encyclopedia. Qwyrxian should learn more in this important aspect from other administrators including admin [[user:Magog the Ogre|Magog the Ogre]]. --"

Neither Peter, Steve, or I harmed the encyclopedia by our actions, but we definitely didn't think them through and realize what the consequences might turn out to be. I think that is what is most important to note about his past actions. He's realized that actions like those during 2008-09 aren't acceptable, and he's realized it was a mistake and has apologized several times for it. He never intended to hurt this encyclopedia he was simply impatient, as I'm sure we all have been. Wikipedia is a site made for people who have a passion for spending their time helping others, and Steve's been doing that since he got here. Looking at his triumphs in the mediation area one can see how he is very level-headed, and that the so-called rash actions are in his past on this site. Anyone can see now that Steve deserves the mop, and that he is a net positive to this encyclopedia. I too see no worries in handing the simple tools of adminship to Steve, and I'm positive no one in the oppose section can tell me how he would possibly do harm to this site. The human brain is a complex thing, more complex than any computer on earth, yet we as humans are prone to making mistakes - it's how we learn everything about ourselves and the world around us, ''""through trial and error""''. If we were to be stopped from advancing forward during our short life due to every mistake we make, be it small or large, we would all end up locking ourselves inside our homes waiting for death to take us away. <small><nowiki></purposefully dramatic></nowiki></small>.

I support this one believing he will make a good admin and knowing that if he doesn't I'm going to sucker punch him in the spine the next time I see him... and then run, because he hits back. And as far as temperament, he's still the same guy he's always been, but his ability to process and regulate his emotions has matured and he's also checked his sense of humor in many regards. Additionally, he has available to him many friends and editors who are all too eager to put things into perspective for him if he should so request (and perhaps even if he doesn't). He's been here a long time and has a great deal of experience across the project. He also has his priorities in a respectable order and is a qualified candidate for areas in need of further admin attention. If you have concerns about him, please take the time to look through his contributions, for he genuinely has put forth the effort to improve himself, as I said before, as an editor and a person. <big>"

Jenks24,Ctjf83,-1,-1,2011,"16:06, 16 January 2011","'''Oppose'''. First off the candidate has my sympathies for the debacle that this RfA has become and for the personal attacks that he has obviously received due to his sexual orientation during his years at wikipedia (though not in this RfA, I hasten to add). Basically the reason I'm in oppose is that many of the opposes above give very really and concerning reasons, and together, they culminate in me not having enough confidence in you to have the tools. As an atheist myself, I can see why you have the userbox in question and personally I don't believe it is enough to warrant an outright oppose, but the confrontational manner in which you responded does concern me, especially the claims that it was kept at MfD so it is clearly fine. The fact that it even went to MfD should give you an indication that at least some people find it offensive. The sig issue concerns me very slightly, as I struggle to read it and find it unnecessarily colourful. Also (although you clearly don't mean it to), it does appear very MySpace-y. I must, however, say that I was pleased to note your removal of the confrontational user talk header. For me though, there are three main reasons why I'm in oppose. Firstly, that you needed to be told (whether it was in a roundabout manner or not) that you had missed the 3RR on Q6. This is partially Sven's fault, as you may have realised yourself without prompting, but you never got the opportunity and now it simply looks as if you forgot (or worse, didn't know) until you were told. Secondly, the incorrect non-admin closure. It's not really the decision you reached (yes, it should have been kept) but that you ""supervoted"" that it was your opinion that he passed the GNG, rather than saying that the consensus was that he passed the GNG (the AfDs Coucelles points out are also troubling). Finally, and in my opinion most importantly, are Mkativerata's copyvio concerns. As he says, you only fixed the problems that were identified in March and didn't take the initiative to fix your other copyvio problems before they again had to be raised in September. Although all of these concerns are obviously forgivable in the case of an editor, they are not so in the case of a prospective admin."

RA has been an excellent contributor over many years and has given a lot to the 'pedia. However, he has certain, shall we say, characteristics that are acceptable in an editor but undesirable in an admin. He is very attached to his own opinion and is sometimes slow to open up to ideas or arguments that haven't come from him. He can be very verbose and, whether he realises it or not, tends to overwhelm other editors with sheer word count. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style/Ireland-related_articles&diff=next&oldid=448619364 Here] is a recent example: even though I agreed with what he said, it comes across as an attempt to dominate the discussion. He is also quite sensitive, and can sometimes take the most casual remark as a personal sleight. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Scolaire&diff=next&oldid=337395644 This] is one of four or five times I was on the receiving end of that. Thin skin in an admin (pardon the assonance) is a dangerous trait. To be quite honest, I would be nervous if I saw him intervening in a dispute as an admin, because I would never know which way he was going to jump. An admin needs to be clear-headed and dispassionate; RA often is, but just as often isn't.

I could not trust an administrator to block vandals if they have virtually no experience with rollback/AIV.  Thirdly, and possibly most importantly, he states that he is ""also interested in the Speedy Deletion process.""

Indeed, Wikipedia is a collaborative encyclopedia but I see little content development apart from a GA or so (please correct me if I am missing anything). I cannot support this candidate not because I disagree with his opinions at XfDs, but because I perceive a serious flaw in his mindset that I think will lead to (unintended) bias in closing deletion discussions.

It might seem silly, but the word ''vehemently'' stood out as I was reading the answer to Q3. Passion is good, vehemence can be damaging. I would expect an administrator, when faced with something they really don't like, like Jéské and the pending changes, to be able to continue to function as an administrator, and not feel compelled to resign dramatically in protest, or cause unnecessary dramaz.

I hope Acdixon won't take this as crticism of their contributions as there's nothing that I see to criticise, I simply don't see enough to go on regarding how good they'll be as an admin.--"

I don't believe I have ever come across him in my Wikipedia-travels although I have worked on some of the same articles, but then again I did not check my Talk Page for potential exchange. As he has prior experience in combination with the experience gathered in his fairly recent return, it appears that he certainly has the experience to be a contributing administrator. Further, attitude and perspective seem to be much more important attributes than policy knowledge. One can always look up policy knowledge, it really is of greater importance that the potential-admin can manage their encounters and confrontations without losing their head and near-term temperament. While several administrators have a history of impulsive behavior it does not appear that this person, while (as he acknowledges) has strong opinions that he has displayed on Talk Pages, it seems that his ability to contain his impulses, and simply express those impulses as arguments on Talk Pages, makes him a viable addition to the ""Wikipedia Ruling Class.""

You have made about 7000 edits total.  About 60% of them are to talk pages.  Your contributions to Wikipedia articles are typically short, so have not accounted for a lot of content.  While I think you can handle the admin tools and probably understand them, being an admin is more than competence about the tools; it also refers to an attitude which enables you to discuss what it is like to edit Wikipedia and promote the development of articles to excellence.

Nor do I share Short Brigade Harvester Boris's concern - commitment to the project is in my view  a good thing and multiple RFAs are perfectly OK, provided the candidate reacts to the reasons why people have opposed. But I'm not really comfortable with Ironholds having the delete button and block buttons. The incident I've queried in Question 15 is too recent. As is [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Buffalo_Kill&diff=prev&oldid=400660368 this, where Ironholds jumped in straight with a level 4 warning, and I'm still wondering whether it was vandalism or a good faith attempt to rename an article by cut and paste.] Both of these imply to me that the reasons why Ironholds has previously been thought unsuitable for adminship are still current.

Hopefully not, but I do suspect he would be too quick with both the block and delete buttons, so with great reluctance I must oppose. ''"

Mkativerata,Neutralhomer,-1,-1,2011,"20:11, 26 March 2011","Sorry. The block log ''per se'' is not a problem. Indeed, the candidate can be given credit for choosing to press on with the account. But Coffee's diffs above show an ongoing propensity for conflict ''escalation'', not avoidance and resolution. Having 2,000 edits to ANI, many of which are recent, (which ''per se'' is a concern) suggests that the candidate will not be able to help steering clear of ANI despite the nomination statement. We therefore have to be certain that the candidate will defuse drama and not be a magnet for it. And the edit summary usage is awful.

My first instinct was to avoid this RfA altogether, since I find it generally dismay-inducing, and am not under the illusion that the process is desperate for my input. But I would like to say something in support of the candidate, despite the fact that I oppose his adminship. <br />I would have opposed this RfA on the basis of that early AfD closure. For my money, we need to observe deletion procedure and timelines in all but the most open-and-shut cases (e.g. nominator withdraws the nomination but doesn't close it). I would also like to have seen a more robust response to the identified copyright concerns, and a more proactive approach to ensuring that no more are present - I want to see a prospective admin showing a little more appreciation for the potential problems here. I'm not totally sold, either, on ''some'' of the candidate's responses to comments in this RfA - though I would be astonished if frustration was not playing a part by this point.<br />But I am putting myself here to try to counter some comments I find frankly upsetting, concerning the candidate's representation of his identity on his userpage. CTJF83, you must have the thickest skin in the world to be putting up with this. Leaving aside for a moment the question of adminship, we're really happy to tell our gay contributors, including ones we ''know'' have been harassed ''here on Wikipedia'' for being gay, that we'd all feel more comfortable if they'd just pipe down, lower their heads, and avoid making a big deal out of who they are (where devoting something like 50*50 pixels of screen space to saying they're proud to be gay apparently constitutes making a big deal)?<br />The candidate's attitude and personality are a world away from mine, but I am dismayed that anyone would construe his willingness to express pride in a part of his identity as evidence of a combative personality unsuitable for adminship.

For all the good work that he has done, Mr. Schmidt has persistently shown an utterly wretched understanding of WP:V and WP:RS, in particular with regard to their application to BLPs. As his answer to my question 18, above, demonstrates, he sees nothing wrong with citing a source in an AFD without bothering to determine it satisfies RS -- and, even worse, without checking to make sure it actually involves the correct person (as in the AFD I mentioned, where he identified a 10-year-old child as a porn performner). Equally disturbing is his interminable wikilawyering, to deny the obvious fact that he screwed up quite badly. '''Wikipedia should have no use for administrators who shoot first and avoid questions later.''' His answer to my question 17 is also disconcerting, since he acknowledges that he tailors his RFA statements to promote his chances, rather than accurately reflecting his positions/opinions. And, as Cunard quite accurately noted, only last month in a sometimes contentious AFD Mr. Schmidt initially insisted the article subject satisfied an applicable SNG , without bothering to verify the claim, even though the nominator's statement (admittedly by one HWolfowitz) pointed out that the claim was belied by the actual announcement of the awards. Administrative authority should be accompanied by demonstrated responsibility, and Mr. Schmidt's determined and repeated insistence that an editor need not bother to verify that sources they cite in Wikipedia discussions meet Wikipedia standards, or even actually deal with the correct person, is a demonstration of acute irresponsibility."

Using that logic, no one but admins would ever tag anything for deletion or copyvio - so hardly anything would be tagged! For me, the importance of seeing an RfA candidate tagging SDs and CVs is to see that they know what is a suitable article/image for such tagging. If I see a candidate with 200 speedy deletion tags, and most of them are declined, that shows me that they do not understand the criteria. If, on the other hand, I see 200 tags (especially across different SD criteria) and they are mostly deleted as a result, that shows they understand the criteria. I am sitting here on the neutral sofa, rather than the oppose one, as the numbers show that as it stands, you are unlikely to be successful in this RfA. My advice - before going for another RfA, do speedy deletion and copyvio tagging, and get more involved in xfDs - you mention wanting to close them, but over the last 2 years, you have only been involved in 7 or 8 of them, and several of those are comments rather than !votes.

Long length of service without problems that I can find, and I've seen this user around and find them to be intelligent and reasonable. I'm afraid the questions to the candidate here have become a textbook example of RfA overkill, and the candidate's answers strike me as level-headed and reasonable nonetheless. I've looked carefully at the opposes up to this time, and I'd like to try to explain in detail why I find them unconvincing. One substantive concern centers around supposedly ""wrong"" (or slow) answers to questions. It's been observed recently at [[WT:RFA]] that questions can become a sort of battleground for editors who have strong opinions about disputed areas of policy, with questions to which ''any'' answer the candidate can possibly give can be seized upon as evidence of being on the wrong side of something that, in fact, is still being debated elsewhere. That's what I see here. I've read all of the candidate's answers, and I find nothing that demonstrates wrong thinking about policy or a desire to subvert consensus, only things where some editors have pet views that weren't immediately parroted by the candidate, and are being construed as misunderstanding policy. The candidate's civility in the face of this is exactly what a good administrator would do. The other substantive issue concerns the lack of content experience. It seems to me that it ''can'' be a problem if a candidate is unable to demonstrate that they know how to navigate complex matters of disagreement over content, and I'm willing to oppose on that basis. But let's not overlook the fact that it is possible to demonstrate that ability in other ways. I've noted the long edit history without blocks and the calm demeanor during this RfA. At the risk of over-focusing on a single diff, let me point to this one from my watchlist: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marine_invertebrates&action=historysubmit&diff=397413465&oldid=397411134], which shows a good ability to get the information right. The opposes have shown me a lot of failures to jump through meaningless hoops, but nothing that would indicate misuse of the tools. (Parenthetically, I'd also like to compliment the candidate on not revealing their gender, a practice that I too attempt to follow. It's not a substantive reason to support or oppose an RfA, but I just wanted to say that.) --"

JamesBWatson,GiantSnowman,-1,-1,2011,"16:50, 15 January 2011","'''Oppose''' There is no doubt that GiantSnowman is a very good contributor, as several people have pointed out. However, being a good contributor of material and being a good potential administrator are not synonymous, and I see several reasons to think that here we have a Wikipedian who will make a better contribution to the encyclopaedia by writing than by administration. I see no evidence of any significant involvement in any administration related areas except for AfDs, to which GiantSnowman is a significant contributor. Contributions to AfDs are mostly sound, but they mostly consist of a simple statement, often along such lines as ""oppose, as he does not meet [[WP:ATH]]"". There is nothing wrong with such simple contributions, but they do not show any evidence of ability to discuss and weigh different arguments, balance one aspect against another, or consider the details of policies or guidelines, which are ''absolutely vital'' needs for an administrator, particularly one who indicates that deletion is likely to be their main area of operation. I also see insufficient interaction with other users for someone hoping to become an admin. It is essential for admins to show  an ability to engage in discussion and debate. GiantSnowman makes relatively few user talk page contributions, and those that do occur are often minimal. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Emeraude&diff=prev&oldid=407347048 Here] GiantSnowman said ""you incorrectly added an 'BLP Unrefenced' tag to [[Nicolas Cinalli|this article]]; the correct tag you should be using in such circumstances is {{template|BLP sources}}"", but gave no indication whatsoever why that is so. The recipient of this message then followed this up, and GiantSnowman did then take part in discussion, but largely to dismiss the other editor's view. The article in question contained a couple of external links which the other editor did not consider suitable as references, while GiantSnowman did. My own view is that GiantSnowman was right to consider them references, but they are of such poor quality that the other editor's opposing view is by no means an unreasonable one. An admin should be able to understand another editor's point of view and explain their reason for disagreeing, ''not'' simply dismiss the other view. I also think there should have been at least some indication of the reason with the original post. Having said all that, it is only fair to acknowledge that on this occasion GiantSnowman did actually contact the editor and start the discussion, rather than simply change the tag on the article without comment. Looking at the candidate's answers to questions above I see a few things which I am not entirely happy about. I do to some extent share concerns about question 6, but I will not dwell on that, as I think the concerns have been exaggerated by other editors, and in any case it is an issue on which there is a range of opinions. I am actually much less happy with the answer to question 7. No administrator should be willing to give a categorical ""never"" to such a question. I am not sure what Fastily meant by ""established"" in the question, but no matter how well-established an editor, if they do something totally unacceptable they need to be blocked, and in some cases (such as persistently making really serious libellous statements) there may not be time for a warning. One should not usually block any user (registered or not, established or not) without warning, but there are times when exceptions are necessary, and anyone who does not realise that is showing a lack of understanding of basic principals which every admin should have. I could pick on more details, but I think I have written enough to show the nature of my reservations. As I have already said, we have here a very good contributor of content, but no evidence of the kind of skills, understanding, or experience needed to become an equally good administrator. I sincerely believe that GiantSnowman will make a better contribution to Wikipedia by continuing to write content than by diverting their time away from that job and into administration."

In the example I cited, the user made 81 edits over four days, edits that were so bad another person reverted darned near all of them. But what the hell, his Edit Count is nearly 100 ticks higher! Woo hoo! In the copy-editing, vandal-fighting, spell-checking dungeon where I spend a good deal of my time, this is not at all uncommon; if you incent a behavior, you'll see more of it. Even. worse. are. the. editors. that. save. every. stinkin'. word. as. a. separate. edit.

Personally, I don't think we—an organization trying to encourage volunteers to donate their time—have any business belittling their efforts. And, as [[User:Ironholds|Ironholds]] ([[User talk:Ironholds#top|talk]]) stated in another RfA, far more eloquently than can I: <blockquote>''Are you a content writer? I am, and I can tell you that if you think just producing the raw content is the most important thing in the world, you're mistaken. There are writers, there are copyeditors, and there are janitors. All have a role to play, and when we're discussing someone's aptitude for janitorial tools, an absence of writing should not be an issue. Wikipedia's tagline is ""the encyclopedia that anyone can edit"", and since ""anyone"" includes ""dicks"", someone who thinks that countering those dicks is not a prime goal is simply wrong, as is somebody who mistakes ""our main goal"" for ""our only goal, to the exclusion of all other contributions"". Have you got any evidence, whatsoever, that JaGa is incompetent in the janitorial field? He's applying for janitorial tools, he's asking for the trust of the community in using them. If you cannot find evidence to indicate that he'd be a bad person to hold them, all other concerns are irrelevant.''</blockquote> Bravo! We need more of this thinking! Me, personally? I wouldn't stand a snowball's chance here because, as soon as someone implied my 500 or so rarely-reverted edits over three or so years (and the hundreds of no-charge hours they represent) don't measure up to some arbitrary and capricious '''number''', I'd likely tell them—loudly—to take a long walk on a really short pier on a really cold day.

There are far too many examples of heated responses that were clearly not thought through in this RfA alone: ""Salvo, would you care to tell me why you embellished this report to highlight that I filed the report before the user even edited when that is not true?"", ""If you don't like what I posted to Fastily's talkpage that is fine.

He didn't directly respond to that but when someone else reminded him, he said it was accidental and went back and added references. I was willing to AGF at that point; we all make mistakes. However, at ''that point'', a careful editor would have done a spot check to see if there were any ''more'' unreferenced article creations from the past month. I just did a spot-check myself, to see whether I should remain neutral or change my !vote, and found two more unreferenced articles in the same time period: [[Southampton Rangers]] and [[Deportivo Mongomo]]. I am willing to grant that these may be accidental too; but if that's the case, the candidate is simply not diligent enough, in my opinion, for the tools at this point."

Essentially although your edits have been sound, I question your maturity to a certain degree.

I have no doubt that if he slips again that it will be dealt with as it has been before (with, perhaps, a slightly different attitude from Sarek based on what's happened here), and as far as I can tell the previous issues were generally resolved. If he were running for ArbCom or asking for the oversight bit or something along those lines, it would be a different story for me, because those are bigger deals (even though they sometimes makes mistakes, too ;)).

Thus, while I commend all the word Dayewalker has done, I'm not comfortable with giving him adminship yet."

And for those opposing over low percentages of project and user talk space edits, the only reason the percentages are low is because of the high number of mainspace contribs.

Revision deletion, commonly referred to as RevDel, is normally used for [[WP:CFRD|these purposes]]. It can also be used on large page histories.

I was a little concerned to see the candidate's most recent article creation was a BLP of a minor with no third party sources (just a bio from the actress's own agency), but the answer to question 5 suggests she recognizes the article needs better sourcing, so I won't complain too much about that. References on [[Captain Nigel Croker]] seem a little dodgy as well (one to a forum, the other to an unofficial fan site), but the candidate's other 11 article creations seem to be solidly referenced. Although some people might balk at 73% automated edits, I'm not particularly bothered by it, since that still leaves 8,800 ""manual"" edits, which is plenty to judge a candidate on, and I for one appreciate all the vandal-fighting work she's done.

This RfA will fail, but don't take it to heart too much. I would advise you largely keep doing what you're doing. Additionally, I would suggest that you spend a little of your time showing that you have the necessary judgement for an admin. For me, the best way to do that is to get more involved in AfD, showing that you understand how policy and guidelines should be ''applied'' (which involves a far more developed argument than ""per nom"", ""per the above user"" or ""per the GNG""). At the moment we don't have much of a track record to go on to measure your judgement. Other suggestions include going through an editor review before a future RfA attempt, ''taking any advice that comes out of that'', and to wait for someone to nominate you next time around (once you've gone through a constructive editor review you tend to be on people's radars).

That has continued here. It's not good enough, in my view, for a prospective administrator. ''2. Userbox''. Setting out your beliefs and values on your userpage is perfectly acceptable. Explicitly belittling those of others as myths and superstitions isn't. That distinction shouldn't be lost by any administrator.

If anything goes wrong, it can almost always be made right by acknowledging a problem and stating what steps one will take to make sure it never happens again.

It is good that HangingCurve can do good work, and wow! this user has done so much good work!  What a time commitment and dedication and awesome record! But I do not vote admins in for doing good work - I vote them in when I am sure that if something goes wrong, they will not upset any other users.

Secondly, concerns expressed above regarding reliable sourcing, marginal etiquette concerns re. bolding of text in this RfA, the AfD rushed votes in November, and this being a relatively new account, push me over the line into this section.

I've always held the view that we can't restrict young people from editing unless we rescind being a free-as-in-speech encyclopedia, and alienating them is doing an injustice to those of our younger sysops/crats/editors who do a remarkable job.

From the statements made above, it seems that this isn't a situation where due to some unconnected reason, e.g. harassment, an editor has switched to a new account and is unhappy about disclosing their previous identity. If that is indeed the case case, the right course of action is to disclose the past account and let the community judge for themselves whether there has been a ""fresh start"" and whether past issues have been addessed. I note that a ""respected editor"" who was a ""critic"" is stated not be opposing this RfA - no doubt a statement from them here that past concerns had been addressed would impact upon potential opposition resulting from the past account being revealed.<br/>Nothing that has been said so far convinces me that there is a need for secrecy and I do not think the community is so unforgiving that conduct under a previous name more than a year ago (I am assuming no overlap between the accounts) will not be forgiven.

Reviewing their recent contributions, I found a number of troubling CSD nominations. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iden_Green&oldid=424274136 Example 1], the db tag had two reasons, 1) ""disambiguates two or fewer extant Wikipedia pages and whose title ends in ""(disambiguation)"" (i.e., there is a primary topic)"" 2) disambiguates no (zero) extant Wikipedia pages, regardless of its title. Asserted to be non-controversial maintenance. See CSD G6."" This was a list of two locations with the same name, it did not end in (disambiguation), and this had useful information that was not duplicated elsewhere, while perhaps eligible for deletion under an alternative process, it was clearly not a good candidate for G6. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dictionary_of_chemical_formulas/E&oldid=423208890 Another list] with the same tag, this one had substantial content. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_highways_numbered_467&oldid=425011400 List of highways] being CSDed as a disambiguation page. Then there is [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Navalpakkam&oldid=425548492 this] A3 CSD of a town complete with infobox, clearly not a good A3 candidate, and I think it would even survive an AfD.

And finally, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vagisa_Munivar&oldid=427065645 this] A7 CSD on an article that even in that version cleary indicates why the person was important, namely ""He is the author of Gnanamrutham"". CSD is a process that should only be used carefully, and is designed for urgent or patently obvious and uncontroversial deletions. Clearly the candidate does not understand the proper application, which scares me in light of the interest in handling them. <s>Also, a minor issue, but the candidate failed to follow the instructions and improperly transcluded this RFA at the end of the list instead of the top.</s> (striking, transclusion was by nominator, not candidate)"

Although only one incident, the answer to Q3 was concerning enough to prompt me to look at the rest.  My biggest problem with the answer to Q3 is that it is offered as an example of how the nominee responds to conflict, and as such, is not a good one.  Had the nominee simply said ""I got into confict and I was quite wrong-- something that I accept today"", I suspect he might be passing RFA easily; to be able to admit when you are so clearly and blatantly wrong is a sign of maturity and competence.  The incident was recent.  That the nominee doesn't recognize how wrong he was, and offers this as an example of how to handle conflict, is a concern for me; I had a big issue, leading to an RFC once, with an immature admin who wouldn't simply acknowledge that his use of tools was wrong, which could have easily solved the whole thing without wasting many other editors' time.  Two other problems with his response there:  ""I've been around long enough that people should know by now I would be smarter than to ask for medical advice on Wikipedia)...it could have been answered with a simple link or explanation to the differences in symptoms between two conditions.""  1)  A possible tendency towards arrogance which may make it hard to recognize when one is wrong (""I would be smarter""???), and 2) ""it could have been answered with a simple link"" shows a willingness to disrespect other editor's time-- if it could have been answered with a simple link, then do it yourself.  Looking at the rest of the picture, I simply do not see enough content contributions from this editor to assure me that maturity, knowledge, and competence are present.  The recent uncited articles are another big concern, showing both a lack of respect for other editors' time (someone else will have to clean those up, and that should have been done by now by the nominee) and a lack of respect for core Wikipedia policies.  All in all, too many concerns that are too recent."

I agree with the candidate on Q6, though he should have stated more clearly that he was assuming that the was evidence for the key accomplishment. I do not think he   ignores WP:V--for the PROF example he is making the assumption that WP:Verifiability for the position could be met, and similarly for the athletic accomplishments. Obviously an article asserting notability without any evidence at all for the key points  would not possibly be kept, and would be unlikely to get as far as AfD in the first place.

But I wouldn't be myself if I didn't check his actual contributions to see whether my feeling was correct. And unfortunately, for a candidate who wants to work in speedy deletion, RE has made some mistakes in the past: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skotfoss_Bruk&diff=438571747&oldid=438571646 This A7] just seconds after creation was truly bad. The rest of the taggings I found concerning were not bad as such, but look as if he had been impatient and overly hasty. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armin_Gr%C3%BCn&diff=424025553&oldid=424024757 This A7 6 minutes after creation] for example or [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Demal_mac_Rothechtaid&diff=prev&oldid=434628827] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maen&diff=prev&oldid=434628713]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=M%C3%A1rta_Egerv%C3%A1ri&diff=prev&oldid=438241765 This G7] was hasty as well, given that new users regularly remove all content to replace it with new one, not knowing how Wikipedia works. I'm somewhat baffled by [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wiseass&diff=prev&oldid=434116814] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wisecracker&diff=prev&oldid=434116772] but I'm sure RE now knows what {{tl|wi}} is. Again though, those examples show a worrying tendency to act overly hasty. That said, in most of the cases I found, he realized his mistake moments afterwards and reverted himself and if there is a quality that every admin should possess, then it's the ability and willingness to perceive one's mistakes and the willingness to admit and rectify them. Because I think this is one of RE's main character traits, I am willing to assume that he is able to learn from those mistakes and will not be the ""shoot first and check later"" kind of admin if this request succeeds (we have already too many of those). My willingness is also fueled by the fact that the amount of such mistakes is somewhere near 1% of his taggings, so it's more likely that those were genuine mistakes and not normal behavior.

For example: Pbl1998 asked an appropriate question [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGiantSnowman&action=historysubmit&diff=406578340&oldid=406450619 here], but all GS did was mark it as unsigned [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGiantSnowman&action=historysubmit&diff=406578627&oldid=406578340] without actually replying to the contributor, which left Pbl lacking his/her patience with another comment [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GiantSnowman&diff=next&oldid=406578627 here]. All admins should explain their reverts except in obvious cases (e.g. vandalism). I'm afraid with that evidence he isn't civil enough to be an administrator."

That was a very lame response to Colonel Warden's Question #5, which is critical to SPI's.  Also the nominee completely dismissed Question 11.  It's not like these questions require 10 page essays, but ignoring them (essentially) is indicative of immaturity.  There are a limited number of admins, and I'd prefer one that is extraordinarily knowledgeable about a lot of policy around here.  I don't need them to know every arcane thing that pops up, but a good chunk of it.  This is a lot of evidence that leads me to conclude that the nominee is just too young/immature for admin tools."

I also don't see the sudden need for Nick to have the tools only after becoming slightly active again over the past two months, and he's apparently only ""observed"" critical admin areas (places stated in A1) before then. Having admin rights shouldn't be something you learn ""[[OJT|on the job]]"", but should instead be granted to those who not only show a clear need for them, but also a clear understanding on what they should do with them when they have them.

I'd love to see more admins who have a healthy level of long term involvement of a couple of hours a week during which they make a handful of thoughtful edits. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate those who spend hours a day and rack up many thousands of edits a year; just that is not the only way to be an effective admin and I think it is beneficial to have others who do not, and thus are less susceptible to potential groupthink. That aside, back to NP specifically - I would have loved to see greater contribution to content, and more nuanced responses to some of the questions on policy. But that is mitigated by NP's overall experience, by his apparent contributions to pragmatic policy change, and by his interaction style.

There is ""tedious repetitive"" work there - clearing the expired prods out for one thing. However, deleting CSD tagged articles and closing XfDs isn't just routine button clicking. Anyone can slap a CSD tag on. Very often articles that need to go are tagged wrongly - either wrong criterion or CSD when they should be prod. Some should stay, possibly needing help. If you don't have a reasonable amount of experience tagging and watching the resulting admin action and on occasions querying it - how are you going to decide which are right and which are wrong? When I started CSD tagging, I got knocked back on quite a few. I took note and increased my accuracy. Copyright is another tricky area. What is public domain, what is licensed and what ain't? Some people think that because the US Govt stuff is public domain, other Govt stuff will be. UK isn't - but it may be licensable. It may not. And closing a contentious AfD is another matter altogether. It may just be that you over-emphasised this sort of work in your answer to Q1, or under-emphasised your potential contribution in other areas.

It was inappropriate for Steve to log into [[User:Coffee|Chet]] and [[User:PeterSymonds|Peter]]'s accounts to perform admin actions. It was also poor judgment to use another editor's account on Simple English Wikipedia despite being banned from this site for having done exactly the same thing here. But aside from those breaches of policy, Steve never did any harm to Wikipedia through his actions. And that's why I have always opposed his ban. We basically told an invaluable contributor that he's no longer welcome on Wikipedia just because he made some huge mistakes, and he remained gone for several months. He owned up to his decisions and accepted the consequences for them. There was no need to punish him any further. But that was way back in 2008; here we are in 2011.

You have done excellent work developing article content. However, while this is admirable, it doesn't qualify an individual for adminship. I know one editor on Wikipedia with over 250k edits to his/her name. Less than 1.5 percent reflect communicating with others via user talk pages, less than .4 percent involve edits to the Wikipedia namespace, and less than .05 communicating with others in the Wikipedia talk space. I consider this person a valued member of the Wikipedia community. I don't mind cleaning up the articles created or flagging for lack of notability. That said, sometimes it's frustrating because this individual will not communicate with others, and displays minimal understanding and experience interpreting Wikipedia policies and guidelines. A candidate for adminship needs to be able to understand, interpret, and effectively communicate with others, a complex range of policies and guidelines. If an admin doesn't know the answers at the time, they must be able to research in order to find the answer in a timely manner. The answers to questions 6-8 illustrate that you are not yet able to effectively manage the basic knowledge of which all admins should have a firm grasp. I find in various RFAs, individuals fall on one side or the other when it comes to article creation. Admins need to have a sure knowledge and effective level of expertise in writing and editing content. But this is not the end of knowledge. In my opinion, it would be beneficial if you were to spend some time reading, reviewing, and coming to an understanding of the policies and guidelines regarding the basic nature of the notability guidelines, along with reliable and independent sources. Honestly, I don't know much about science or sports. I tend to stay away from those subjects. That said, I've reviewed the notability guidelines for sports and athletes and have a solid understanding of the criteria for notability. I have also formed definite opinions. The criteria needs to be made consistent and expanded to include more sports. Heck, I'm a chick, but for crying out loud, where's the boxing criteria? But I digress. In the end, press releases and university/corporate bios? Not reliable. Not independent. Established, regular editors or admins? Block when appropriate. Legal threats, sockpuppets, edit wars/3RR, compromised accounts, gross incivility, harassment, unapproved bots, and outing and/or disclosure of confidential/personal information.

I've taken into account that you only wish to work in moves, but IMO, it is necessary that admin candidates be well-rounded, with some degree of experience in most fields pertaining to administrators (e.g. XfD, AIV, ANI, RFPP, CSD). The sysop toolset comes as a complete package, and campaign promises to remain within a certain discipline can quickly drift off into the sidelines when one is presented with the entire toolset.   With regards to your edits in the User talk namespace, I feel that the number of edits you make to the mainspace is largely disproportionate to the number of edits you make in the user talk namespace.

TCO,Feezo,-1,1,2011,"19:38, 19 March 2011","'''Not now'''.  I was actually weak support at first. And sorta feel ""neutral"".  So this is a pretty ""weak"" oppose.  Really, I think you could do fine, but would like to see a little more work from you.  Have done a little more research:  read talk page, read user page, looked at the editor review, looked at Perl article (relevant diff of month-long improvement [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Perl&action=historysubmit&diff=411132163&oldid=405356426], read the spinout of the Perl article, looked at the ship article.  Basically, I would prefer a bit more content creation and participation in the project.  Pretty similar overall rationale to Kudpung although with some nuance differences.  The GA is decent work, but looking over it, it was a save, not one where you built the majority of it.  There were a few places where you added refs (that sorta tells me new content was coming in, not just a re-org).  The ship article had no sources (fine, I guess on the copyright, but not showing synthetic creation.)  Just a little more work in the ""making something"" mode would benefit you to understand what we are doing here.  Then back to cleaning away rubbish at NPP.  I don't care too much about the break in service.  We have people come and go all the time.  A better solution for the concern of inactive sysops would be term-limited adminship (would also make the moderators more a class of normal users, returning to normal citizenship after a term).  As far as spending time in admin-lite areas to merit the tools, I don't always see this as a need.  Someone like the two RFAs below(or say Sandy or Tony) where it is obvious the user is life-seasoned and capable of synthesizing and thinking, I don't need them to show some specific mop-handling skills...I would feel confident with them in the corporate work world in all kinds of staff assignments and some buttons on WP don't bug me.  They can figure out both mechanics and norms of usage.  For someone who is mostly a ""janitor"", perhaps it is a little more important to do some of the admin training work first.  Net, net:  '''actually pretty positive on you''' (liked the CSD linked essay from your page).  Just do some more contribution first.  Please."

He is a leading figure in the dispute resolution process; despite not being an administrator he makes well-reasoned AfD closes; he is a valuable SPI clerk; he is very helpful to new and old users alike. He has fully regained my trust, and when he was waffling back and forth about whether to run or not, I encouraged Steve to do so. Even if he should not gain the tools this time around - which I do hope he does, as I feel he has earned them - I have every confidence that Steve will continue to work to improve himself as he has been doing these past three years.
