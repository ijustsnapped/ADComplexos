I would recommend reviewing [[WP:CSD]] and being less hasty about applying those tags. If an article does not look notable, it might be better to apply Prod or AfD. I did not see a lot of AfD involvement. Even if AfD is not your cup of tea, the experience is valuable as there is some overlap in practical application of policy. I did not see reports to AIV. There can be a fine line of distinguishment between vandalism (which is willful and purposeful) and errors due to lack of experience or understanding of our policies. An admin sometimes needs to me a couch rather than a cop or a janitor. I would suggest a balance of article building and admin related tasks, seek an editor review in another 2000 edits and then, depending on the recommendations, submit an RfA about 1000 edits after that. I did not review for article building, but I would like to see at least 30,000 bytes of content added for content builders or several thousand ""wikignome"" type edits to gain experience in article building policies, which also help in recognizing vandalism and notability.

Tiptoety,SchfiftyThree,-1,-1,2008,"21:58, 4 September 2008","'''Oppose''' - The answer to question four is a bit concerning, and clearly demonstrates a lack of understanding when it comes to the protection policy. First off protection is not the end all know all when it comes to edit wars and often it is a select group of editors that are being disruptive opposed to everyone envolved, and that can often be resolved with blocking those who are causing the disruption. Second, SchfiftyThree stated above: ""''If edit wars happened on an article I was involved with, I'd discuss the situation on its talk page about the constant edit warring, and if the users have been warned for edit warring, I'd probably direct them to the discussion on the talk page according to the edit war, and if I protected the article until the situation clears out, I'd let them know.''"". He could not be more wrong, admin tool should ''never'' be used when the admin performing the action is involved in the dispute, and simply notifying the involved parties that you are taking admin action X does not make it ok. I feel like SchfiftyThree's answer to this question is one from a user who has a whole lot of anti-vandalism experience, (judging by him mostly wanting to protect for vandalism reasons) and not a whole lot of dispute resolution or article related experience, and IMO that is needed to be a successful admin."

Avraham,Peteforsyth,1,1,2008,"15:20, 29 April 2008","'''Support''' Requests for adminship are, at their core, a forum in which project participants can opine on the body of work of the submitting candidate and decide whether or not the candidate has demonstrated the knowledge, maturity, and judgment required by the project as a whole of their sysops. It is in these forums that each of us can declare what particular aspects of the sysop responsibility we feel are important, whether or not the candidate has demonstrated sufficient competency in those areas, and whether or not we [[User:Avraham/RfA-B|trust]] the candidate to act in an appropriate manner in situations that may require the mop-and-flamethrower™. In my opinion, Pete has demonstrated the judgment and interactions that I feel are paramount to proper application, and more importantly, non-application, of the tools that the sysop bit affords. Looking at random diffs from his 950+ user talk conversations, I find that he portrays a friendly, polite demeanor, even when in disagreement with the editor with whom he is conversing. This personality trait, that of civility in the face of opposition or worse, is one that I feel is critical to sysops to minimize, if not nearly eliminate, the chances of wikidrama, wheel wars, or worse. Pete's contributions to mainspace articles stand on their own as an indication of his understanding of both the project's ultimate purpose as well as the policies and guidelines that govern the day-to-day workings of the project. The point has been raised about the relative dearth of experience in regards to certain administrative duties. My personal opinion is that while a high level of sophistication can certainly not be claimed, enough understanding has been demonstrated to indicate that the user will not abuse the tools, will fill any knowledge gaps quickly, and will help continue the smooth working of the project. I believe there is a fundamental difference, and the project members [[Wikipedia:Requests for bureaucratship/Avraham|have clearly stated]], between the level of sophistication (at least vis-a-vis RfA's) which we require from bureaucrats, since their actions are more permanent, and sysops, each of whose actions may be corrected, if necessary, by any other admin. This safety net is sufficient enough for me to feel that the remote possibility of a mistake made from ignorance is far outweighed by the positive characteristics that Pete presents. --"

The part about wanting to delete redirects to [[Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece]] is particularly bad. That is what [[WP:RFD]] is for, this has nothing to do with being an admin. She says that she is interested in fighting vandalism and in the AfD process. That is great, but her record in this regard thus far is just too thin for us to be able to make intelligent judgement as to whether or not she would do a good job as an admin there. She has a grand total of 3 AIV reports, and a fairly small number of AfDs where she participated in (I went back and founf 9 AfDs in the last 7 months). There is no AN/I or UAA participation so far either. While it may sound cliche, but in this case the candidate definitely needs more experience in admin-related areas. Regarding other matters, I am moderately bothered by the lack of edit summaries (but not enough for that issue alone to justify an oppose) and a bit more than moderately bothered by the answer to Q4 regarding COI.  Editing an article about a family member is ''always'' a COI, there is no ""Yes and no"" about it.

I agree that poorly-thought-out AfD comments just to increase editcount would be a reason to oppose; however, his AfD comments are generally well-reasoned and intelligent and demonstrate a good knowledge of policy, cf [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Teen_pornography_%282nd_nomination%29&diff=prev&oldid=182009052] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bravery%27s_source&diff=prev&oldid=181844409] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Kulaxingu_Kambamjiji&diff=prev&oldid=181844161]. He has explained that the short time interval between posts is because he uses tabbed browsing, and I see no reason to doubt this. Secondly, the short time interval between RfAs is not a reason to oppose. The last RfA failed without very many good reasons; the only legitimate issue raised by any of the opposers was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Scottandrewhutchins/Userboxes/user_Body_Modification_No&diff=prev&oldid=170232683 this diff] cited by Qst, in which he wrongly attempted to apply T1 to a userspace template (something I warned against in an MfD just before commenting here, incidentally), but for me, one mistake a couple of months ago isn't a deal-breaker. Thirdly, the essays he wrote (some considerable time ago, incidentally) were not in any way problematic. They were all intelligent and well-reasoned. It is ''not'' necessary to agree with Wikipedia's policies, even its core policies, to become an administrator. What ''is'' necessary in an administrator is a willingness to follow policy and community consensus in the exercise of sysop powers, even when it conflicts with his/her own views - and I see no reason to doubt that HSR would be capable of doing this. I note, further, that he has recanted some of the views in his earlier essays. I have some sympathy with Malleus Fatuorum's comment that being bullied into changing one's views shows weakness of character or immaturity, as people should stick to their honest beliefs; however, I don't believe that this is the case here. Rather, I think that HisSpaceResearch has, like all of us, changed his mind and developed a more sophisticated understanding of Wikipedia over time, and accordingly his views on some issues have changed. That is perfectly legitimate, and is not a reason to oppose. I think that some of the opposers need to seriously reconsider their reasoning here - do we really want to rob Wikipedia of a good administrator, just because he failed to jump through the arbitrary hoop of leaving enough time between RfAs? Yes, I understand the common argument that it takes at least a couple of months to address the concerns from the last RfA, but as I've said already, there ''were'' no major concerns that the candidate could address, other than one incorrect speedy tagging from early November. Most of the opposes in the first RfA were based on the premise that a candidate who does not agree with Wikipedia's consensus groupthink on every major issue is not suitable to be an administrator, and that is fundamentally untrue and wrong (not to mention dangerous, as it risks stifling diversity of opinion)."

It isn't so much (for me, at least) that you need to show that you have produced work XYZ for Wikipedia.

If this RfA doesn't pass, I hope that you would take some time to find an article on a subject you love and bring it up to GA (don't worry almost every subject our there has one or two articles that can be improved considerably).  See the conflicts you run in to, the discussions you have and so on.  I think it will be easier to come back after an experience like that.  So why am I in the support column?  Work at AFC, to me, looks pretty good.  It shows that you deal with new and IP editors on a regular basis and you do so willingly.  That you work there and do anti-vandal work shows that you can separate the impression you get from RCP (all new editors look like vandals) from the reality (most aren't).

Iridescent isn't quite on the mark, the reply from the candidate addresses her point about his level of work on the Avatar articles (namely, that most of the work was done on pages transcluded onto the main list page); I wasn't really impressed by the assumption of bad faith there that he'd be intentionally misleading us. Also, I find the userboxes kerfuffle to be quite silly -- we've passed [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Philosopher|candidates]] before with userboxes on the opposite end of the ideological spectrum. However, decisions being made on IRC is a ''very'' bad idea, and the edit to the IWF controversy page was a pretty poor choice as well.

Opposes based on actions made a year ago, opposes based on ONE temporary lapse of judgement, opposes that remind me of in the book ''Dogbert's Clues for the Cluesless'' where [[Dogbert]] is talking about how much to tip your waiter (or waitress) and says ""Minus one dollar because people tailgate"".

There's a lot of general lack of knowledge shown in most of the page, such as not knowing AOR is not binding, not knowing vandalism removal is excepted from 3RR, not knowing why a wheel-war is bad, not knowing IPs cannot create new pages, not knowing userpages are almost always protected upon request, not understanding that dicussing with the owner of a vandalbot is not likely to be productive, not knowing bans only apply to en.wiki, switching the definition of the word neutral with its opposite (in this example, he also shows lack of thoroughness, saying he didn't even fully read the line he was being tested on), not knowing G4 doesn't apply to speedies, not knowing unverifiability is a reason for deletion. Granted, these answers are two to five months old, and he should probably be more knowledgeable by now. However, the page is so positively rife with examples of his lack of clue that I am very concerned. I also just get a general vibe of being too eager for adminship from the page. Looking further, I see he has both a signature shop and a guestbook page. While those aren't neccesarily bad things, they don't seem like particularly mature things to have.

Blofeld of SPECTRE,Nev1,1,1,2008,"21:24, 7 August 2008","'''Support''' -Finally a candidate who is actually an encyclopedia contributor. Personally I don't see this editor's perceived lack of experience in the admin space is a flaw, it many ways this removes any suspicions I would have that he would abuse the tools. I'm sure if presented with a situation he would use the tools responsibly and if there are any grey areas of admin policy I'm sure he can quickly learn once he is under an obligation to act as an admin, even if he doesn't spend much of his time with admin stuff."
Faithlessthewonderboy,MrFish,-1,-1,2008,"05:36, 2 April 2008","'''Oppose''' Mainly because of questions one and four. With his answer to question one, MrFish asserts that he intends to jump headfirst into areas where he has little or no experience if he receives the tools. This is just asking for trouble - not that he would intentionally misuse the tools, but all new admins should start out slowly, and his overeagerness to use the tools in areas which he has never even participated in worries me. As for question four, to be honest, I'm not a fan of these silly questions. ""No big deal"" is one thing, but I'd like to see the RfA process taken a little more seriously. Nevertheless, his answer suggests to me that he would not be great in handling a dispute (we certainly have more than a few smart-ass admins, but we don't need to add to them). Basically, if he ran into an abusive user, I don't think he would be able to keep his cool. Less importantly, he has one of those ""I want to be an admin"" userboxes, which I personally don't think much of, and he's relatively inexperienced in projectspace. I could potentially support MrFish, but not right now."

It's long been established that sportsmen need to have made at least one appearance at the top or professional level to merit an article.  The King AfD shows that Cobaltbluetony is happy to ignore this long standing convention.  Were he to become an admin he'd have the power to act on this belief, in contravention of policies which nearly everyone else accepts.  Allowing American soccer players to have articles before they make an appearance opens the flood gates to having every wannabe player on a teams 'roster' everywhere in the world and for every sport.  This would be a terrible precedent.  Obviously all those voting in favour either do not understand the implications of this or think them unimportant.  If that's the case then fair enough, but it's also fair to raise this issue.  It's not simply a matter about disagreeing on a borderline case, it's about one man's wish to change a oft cited policy which will affect innumerable articles in the future."

Add to that communication ability displayed on editor's talk page, willingness to interact with others as both the initiator and responder, a DYK (we '''are''' mainly about content, after all), willingness to change opinion when appropriate, rather than dig in, no blocks, no evidence of canvassing (user hasn't even placed a talk-page RfA notice), no apparent incidents to explain...what more do we want of an admin? Sure, some will say ""2000 more edits of same stuff"", but do we really have any reason to expect there would be any difference at that point? The only diff offered in the oppose section was politely discussed and reasonably explained. Other than that, I see no diff that shows improper behavior, lack of knowledge, or any reason to actively oppose; the opposes all seem passive to me. I'm not questioning the opposes, just noting that there's none of the usual ""oppose-per-this-edit"" we see. In other words, this editor hasn't done any harm but opposers aren't sure there's enough to reasonably say that no harm will be done. Well, I see some good &mdash; enough to reasonably believe it would continue in the future. I would also note that there are a good many RfA regulars who are staying away from this one.

However, I have no objection to a second RfA at a later date should Lustiger seth gain more experience here, and wants permission to use other parts of adminship. Besides, if Lustiger seth is granted adminship for SBL use only, I'm not worried about him causing negative issues...I'm more concerned about the admin accounts that have been inactive for years, and what possible problems they might cause should they end up applying the adminship of three-plus years ago to today.

I'm not a big fan of telling a candidate what I believe they should be doing to get my vote, but I'd say my oppose comes from the fact that I am not sure how Kumioko will handle tough admin situations involving lots of drama. More involvement in the project space could be what satisfies me. I may be in the school of editors who throws ''no big deal'' to the wind, but I'd like to think of an oppose vote in a situation like this as protecting the community from ''an unknown'', not from the very good editor that Kumioko appears to be. In this RfA, when he had opposition, he responded with diffs like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FKumioko&diff=205789897&oldid=205789875 this] which really bother me. It looks like heat-of-the-moment editing, no sig, it was bitter and immature. If an editor can't fully respect oppose voters (and shows that they can't), I don't feel comfortable with giving them the ability to block. As I've said before, ''it is potentially much more damaging to the community to promote inadequate admins than to reject a potentially good admin that we are unsure about''. To sum up: I am quite unsure, and considering the admin abuse I observe too often for comfort, I don't feel comfortable supporting someone--despite their great editing--who is a very big question mark for handling ''tough admin decisions''."

I appreciate your enthusiasm and your efforts since your last RfA, but I'd like you to have more experience editing the mainspace and adding content before you become an admin. I know that a lot of people claim mainspace contributions aren't relevant to admin tasks, but I think they're key for instilling the kind of attitude I want an admin to have. I think that it's important for admins to have been involved in creating or improving articles so that they can understand how people feel when their articles get deleted, and hopefully they will have more respect for content. I just don't think it's possible to understand and act fairly towards people who mostly edit content if you have no experience of improving content yourself. Wikignomish tasks are important, I agree, but an admin should have been involved in at least the creation of one article or assisting with getting an article to GA. I'm also a little concerned that you take things that happen onwiki [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:VivioFateFan&diff=prev&oldid=181324479 a little too personally]. When I closed your last RFA I [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:VivioFateFan&diff=prev&oldid=181292523 advised] you to wait a few months before renominating - not something you ''have'' to do, certainly, but I'd like you to have been around for a while longer before I trust you with the sysop tools. This is nothing against you, I just think that as we have plenty of admins at the moment we can afford to be picky about who we promote and I think I'd rather wait another two or three months before I feel I can support you. Please try getting involved in some content processes - getting articles to GA is fairly easy! Album articles are especially easy to improve.

Save a few random contribs, virtually every edit is to a hockey article. The candidate is lacking experience in many areas (he admits so [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Krm500&diff=prev&oldid=242849784 here]), and I prefer a more well-rounded candidate.

SM is a generally friendly and helpful user (once kindly correcting me when I was making an error with AfD closes soon after becoming an admin) who makes good contributions. But after reviewing this there are too many concerns. Like Alison, I was rather bothered by both of the answers to question 5, particularly 5a (there's just no getting around the fact that that is a bad answer). Indeed I'm rather underwhelmed by the answers overall. Likewise the initial response to Collectonian's oppose comment is rather snippy which I really don't like to see in RfA's. Probably most importantl though are some obvious problems with AfD closes. I'm all for non-admins closing obvious keep AfD's, but there seem to be some real problems with how SM approaches this (despite a lot of good work). The threads linked by Collectonian are worrisome. Specifically (and I did not look in great detail, these are just a couple of quick examples) [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ali_Baksh&oldid=204380757 this close] is just not acceptable. Not that keeping was necessarily the wrong decision, but with 3 delete !votes and 2 keeps this is not an AfD for a non-admin to close (this was a month and a half ago). Similarly, but less obviously, [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bloody Sunday (1969)|this]] was not a speedy keep. Despite article improvement, there was still a perfectly viable delete comment present and discussion had only proceeded for about 24 hours. The fact that it was almost certainly going to end up a keep is not the point, we generally keep AfD's open for the full five days if there is any doubt as to the outcome, bearing in mind that new information might come in. I can offer strong moral support, and in 6 or 9 months without problems would probably support, but I have too many concerns about judgment at this point. Sorry.--"

In the version I see, Mr. Enigmaman mis-reads <s>""People who police . . . by comments restored by him"" as ""People who police . . . by him"",</s> (''see discussion below this statement'') ""attempted to justify it while removing 'fat nerd'"" as ""attempted to justify it with the term 'fat nerd'"" (or something), and then continues to dispute that he ever said ""deletionist Jihadists"" when it was already explained that this was not what was being claimed. Cookie-cutter block-happy, chattering admins are bad enough, but when they can't even chatter properly... no thanks.

My first and only encounter with the candidate came in October, when he decided to give me a Level 1 warning for not marking CSD tagged articles as “patrolled.”  I then noticed he was on a templating kick and did the same to other editors. When I pointed out that giving template warnings to people who are not vandals was not appropriate, he seemed touchy and refused to strike out the templates (here is the exchange: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:NuclearWarfare&diff=244020681&oldid=244017126#Templating]). In reviewing his work since then, I see nothing that strikes me as being admin-worthy. He has already been called to task for inept AfD closures [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:NuclearWarfare&diff=247338468&oldid=247279251#AfD_closures] and for editing other people’s contributions [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:NuclearWarfare&diff=246180083&oldid=246175598#Not_a_big_deal.2C_but...] – in both cases, he’s touchy when informed of his mistakes. Content creation appears to be nonexistent, which doesn’t help. The answer to Q7 is bizarre – first he won’t answer, then he abruptly claims (with zero evidence) that content creators are more likely not to delete articles. Content creation skills enable an admin to pinpoint how to enhance an article – after all, we are here to build, not destroy. The points raised by Icewedge and Skomorokh only confirm my feelings (and it looks like he was going to badger Icewedge, but caught himself before too much damage was done). Someone who prefers templates to talk, who bristles at benign criticism, who isn’t creating content and doesn’t acknowledge the value of that skill is the wrong person for this job."

Keeper76,Aervanath,1,1,2008,"16:17, 10 November 2008","'''Support'''.  Scott Mcdonald, Iridescent, ''et al'', raise some valid points, but also make some leaps of logic. The content/no content admin debate will go round and round similar to the Great Age Debate.  Sigh.  This Editor is not a vandal, or ""uninterested in content"", will not break Wikipedia, has shown over time that he is here for the benefit of Wikipedia and its editors.  There is a huge assumption that someone (someone with 2300+ content edits no less) who works in a niche/gnomish area couldn't possibly understand how to correctly push a new button (block,protect,delete) on the top of the browser window.  That's a huge assumption, and while possibly correct, it's not correlative and therefore not a qualified ""standalone"" reason to oppose a dedicated editor, IMHO.  As an example (actually, I could probably name ''dozens'' of examples) someone with ''hundreds'' of articles ""under their belt"" could be equally, or even more, inept at pushing a new button (block/protect/delete) on top of their browser window because they are overinvested in content and are unwelcoming to new users that might be trying to [[WP:OWN|improve ""their"" articles]].  Seen it happen. However, I would ''also'' be mistaken to assume that ""primarily content builders"" will therefore, as a group, be bad admins (and I'd get flamed for it no less). Not correlative.  Adminship is a ''character'' issue - not a content issue, and to claim that someone ""doesn't belong"" or ""no content therefore no admin"" is a logical fallacy, an overgeneralization, and in a very convenient way, a civil attack on someone's intelligence and character.  If there are diffs that show Aervanath being a dick, or overreacting, or underreacting, or being uncommunicative, then perhaps more time/experience would be helpful prior to adminship.  In my contribution check, I see no evidence of those ""qualities"", therefore I am compelled to support."

In the interests of full disclosure, I mentioned in early August that perhaps Eco should run for adminship. At that point, I had experienced nothing but positive interactions with Eco. That would soon change. In late August, Eco (after having told me that he didn't feel like he'd be ready for a run until 2009) approached me, asking me to write a nomination for him. I said I'd look into it, and he proceeded to accuse me of ""breaking my word."" I told him that administrators I respect had told me that a conom from me would be stronger than a single nomination from me, as a 3-month-old editor. He became quite angry, and took it off-line as well. I spent the majority of that evening reviewing his history, and having a couple of editors I trust and respect doing the same. The next day, when I declined to write the nomination, based upon some civility concerns he went ""over the edge"", you might say. He stayed mostly off-line with it, but it was one of the worst verbal batterings I've taken online. He made a ton of accusations against DT (none of them founded), and then, when it became clear that his frustration at me wasn't going to change my mind, he apologized to me for how he treated me, saying he hoped we could be friends. I said I'd work with him if there were a project we were both interested in, with the implication that I don't choose to be friends with people who treat me (and other editors as well) that way. I was going to simply abstain, but given his angry reply to DT, and his defensiveness regarding his errant CSD tagging, I felt I must temporarily end my wikibreak. I had planned it during this time specifically not to have to face his wrath, but I can't just stay silent about this. I feel Eco is a great editor, and -- for now, at least -- a poor candidate for adminship. Apologizing after the fact does not excuse the initial incivility. I admire the content contributions, but do not admire the way he deals with conflict. His temperament in the midst of heat doesn't bode well for how he might use the more controversial administrator tools.

The editor has a habit of using only primary sources to write articles without asserting any notability (see [[Daz 4 Zoe]], [[Stephano (Shakespeare)]]). Many of his articles show un-reliable sources cited: see [[I'll Keep You Satisfied]] ([[Geocities]] is cited; the Geocities page is simply the lyrics), [[Positive Discipline]] (one in-line citation with four clean-up tags), and [[SingaLongaWarYears]] (which cites Amazon Customer reviews in its infobox as the only reviewer). I'm just nervous about the mainspace edits, especially considering that his two best articles by his own statement are [[Transit of Venus]], a respectable start class article, and [[George Harrison]] which was quickfailed at GA (though I have no doubt that it'll be up to snuff soon enough).

I can't honestly oppose a user who has done so much work to improve the encyclopaedia, and who would probably be a net benefit as an admin. But I can't bring myself to support either, due to TPH's somewhat aggressive, and sometimes dubious, use of speedy-deletion tags. Deletionism, in itself, is not a crime; it is a legitimate point of view (which I share), that there are too many articles on WP about non-notable subjects. But requesting to have articles deleted on grounds such as CSD A7 (when an assertion of notability, however weak, ''is'' made) or G3 (when the article is self-evidently ''not'' nonsense/vandalism) goes beyond that, and looks like misuse of policy to circumvent the AFD process. I have no doubt that TPH's intentions are good, and that where he has made mistakes, he regrets them; but a good intention does not justify bad methods, and I just can't trust him enough to use the deletion process correctly to honestly support. I wish it were otherwise, and if this RFA fails, I hope TPH improves his judgement to the extent I can support him in a future nomination."

Most users (''especially'' new users) hold Admins in very high-standing, and expect kind-of-alot from them.

It sounds like a case of saying-what-you-think-people-want-to-hear. Although it's certainly nice when someone who adds a comma has an ""adding a comma"" edit summary, by no means is it necessary. If you mark an edit as minor, there's no reason for us not to [[WP:AGF]] and assume that it is, in fact, minor. Actually, this requires the same sort of AGF-ing that would be required if you ''did'' leave edit summaries for minor edits, because in that case we'd AGF by assuming that A) the edits are minor, and B) the edit summaries are honest. But when B is true (regarding a minor edit), it implies that A is true, so it's arguably a bit redundant to leave edit summaries for minor edits. The practice ''is'' also defensible, but my point is that, if you don't like to leave edit summaries for minor edits, it can come across as somewhat ''dis''honest to emphasize their ""importance"" simply because a question pertaining to them arises in an RfA. I realize I'm saying a lot about an issue that doesn't even affect my support--but hey, nothing wrong with some free advice, right? :-)"

What I decided was that some of the oppositional votes just didn't feel right. Examples: Marty Rockatansky states below that this candidate closed [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hank Bergman (2nd nomination)]] via [[WP:SNOW]], and ""there was still discussion going on"". Well, Marty was the sole remaining delete !vote in an 11-1 consensus, with one editor changing his delete !vote to ""strong keep"" after a revealing source ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Hank_Bergman_%282nd_nomination%29&diff=199120318&oldid=199118799 here] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Hank_Bergman_%282nd_nomination%29&diff=199215328&oldid=199196076 here]). While I am in no way discounting Marty's !vote or his right to oppose below, I personally would have closed this as the candidate did. I'm sort of preempting Q10, I know, and I reserve my right to change my !vote based on the answers to the pending questions. However, even after circumspect weighing of Shoessss's and John's arguments below (arguments that certainly make one take pause), I feel this candidate will serve the best interests of Wikipedia and will be a net positive.

Just like with credit history in the US, where you have to build up the trust of the bank by showing you're behaving in a credible way, also in Wikipedia participation in conflicts (e.g. by informal mediation) shows how you're going to react under strong stress and if you are able to stay cool, which may be important in adminship. Also, I was not persuaded by your rationale for mop, and the CSDs you filed  may be held against you.

The opening statement does not speak well at all of the candidate's ability to be neutral in dealing with CSDs, PRODs, and AfDs. In particularly, I find it distributing that you seem to feel that people who are ""deletionists"" as ""emphasizing exclusion and exclusiveness"" and are prompted by the leavings of your real life friends and own feelings to want to support ""avowedly inclusionist contributors."" An administrator should be able to neutrally apply the policies and guidelines of the site, regardless of their own personal preferences, and shouldn't open their RfA by unintentionally insulting a large number of contributers in such a way.  Some of the candidate's comments on their talk page and in several AfDs do not indicate the candidate has yet mastered the necessary patience and communicative skills to deal with annoying and stressful situations. For some quick examples, in [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Celebrity sex tape]] the candidate makes several seemingly snarky and sarcastic remarks in response to other people's delete/keep notes. In [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Wikipedias]], he accuses the nominator of nominating the list in bad faith with no actual evidence and in total violation of [[WP:AGF]]. Useight has already pointed out some questionable edit summaries.

So, if he lacks experience there, I'm not confident in giving him the block button. The candidate is certainly a good contributor for the rest, but it's not the main quality needed for an administrator. I agree with the vast majority of the above oppose comments, and these concerns need to be addressed ''before'' he gets the mop. Btw, I removed the CSD tag that TPH placed twice on [[Best Believe It]], because it's not a blatant hoax, even if TPH is completely sure it's one. {{t1|hoax}} is enough to warn a potential reader, and the afd will go on and close with delete.

The candidate has behaved well for a couple of months, written a few articles, reverted vandalism and reported some vandals - but you don't really know how the candidate will act under stress. That is not the case with this candidate. I've mainly interacted with Lawrence on the waterboarding debacle, where he handled himself well through some very frustrating interactions with others over a long period of time, culminating in an arbitration case. On that basis alone, I think he is suitable for adminship. He is willing to engage in controversial areas, perhaps a little too willing, which will always lead to at least some people disliking him - it goes with the territory. While he will argue his case passionately, he will also listen and reconsider his positions if given rational arguments.

This impression comes in combination with an operative hecticness I'm not unfamiliar with but don't like too much. I have seen fresh administrators assiduously getting involved in all sorts of places, posting at all the *choke* ""high-drama"" places at once, instead of focusing on one locus where they could actually be helpful with depth and due diligence. I am not saying this is the kind of administrator Enigmaman will be, but currently the concerns outweigh the rest. On a final note, not all supporters did the candidate a favor (or the process any service) the way they pounced on some of the opposers. This behaviour should stop, period, but I guess the comment doesn't really belong here. I'm only mentioning it because it annoyed me enough to post this statement. Still, it isn't Enigmaman's fault if he is being protected by a pack of pitbulls, so I'll put in ""neutral"" rather than ""oppose"". (Or maybe I'm just scared of being bitten). ---"

I define active editing as 100-150 edits per month--which I believe is extremely doable by somebody with any degree of commitment to the project.  By that definition, George has not been active on Wikipedia in 4 months.  Why would we grant the tools to somebody who isn't active?

I echo what all the above users are saying in the fact that Cobi has little to no edits outside of bot related duties and as such does not have proper experience to use all the tools. After reading over the nominations it appears that every one only stated Cobi’s expertise when it comes to bots, no strong evidence of solid admin related contributions and clearly no need for the tools. When asked whether he eventually branch out into new admin areas, he stated and I quote “Yes, but only after I have observed the process, read and understood all relating policies and protocols, and feel confident that I understand how things are done in that area.” – Adminship is not the time to observe the process and to read up on policies, that needs to be done as a user. Why request the tools and only state that you are planning on using a few of them, and how are we to know that he will only use those few? We are discussing issuing all the tools to this user, and about whether or not we trust this user to use the appropriately. At this point in time I do not trust Cobi to use them appropriately, with only a handful of contributions to [[WP:AIV|AIV]], [[WP:RFPP|RFPP]], [[WP:ANI|ANI]] ect… how can we see a ability to properly use the tools. Admins need to be well rounded, I am not saying they need to be experts in every part of the project, but well rounded, which Cobi is not. I feel this RfA is more of a popularity contest, due to the fact that Cobi has made a bunch of wikifriends here. Another issue was the use of cluebot to canvass users to !vote in his previous RfA, while that was dealt with it, and was a honest mistake, it really rubbed me the wrong way. If a user is only going to make bot related edits, then use (abuse) it to his gain? I personally do not know Cobi but from the few 2800+ contributions I reviewed, I was not impressed."

Read it through, especially what Mongo is saying and I think you'll agree that instead of ""massive assumptions of bad faith"" you'll find him bending over backwards to AGF. It wasn't Mongo who supplied the heat (such as there was) to that conversation. Mongo, while outspoken, has done significant good for Wikipedia. You don't have to be an admin to do good surely, but I think Mongo has reached the point where he understands the boundaries and will be fine. The Arbcom decision was borderline, and even Jimbo said at the time that he would support Mongo in the future. He was speaking as an editor obviously at the time, so take that for what it's worth to you. In the end, the questions is whether Mongo will be a net gain as an admin and whether he is likely to abuse the tools. At this point I think it's clear enough that he has a good enough understanding of tools not to abuse them and so would certainly be a net gain. Unfortunately there will be some opposes here based on content issues (especially 9/11 conspiracy theory related)...hopefully editors can see through those."

Clearly, you still continue to made great contributions to Wikipedia despite the sanctions, showing real loyalty, and appear to have learnt lessons from your mistakes. Your actions at AfD do not concern me - in fact I think many of your comments there are quite fair to be honest! In any case, all the best."

If you don't like Wikipedia, then why seek additional influence on it? To mold it to your liking? By the way, special thanks to [[User:RogMcDog]] for [http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Paul_McCartney&diff=prev&oldid=360291 this. '''Look at the edit summary.''' '''''Wow''''']. B) Ed's ''history'' of poor judgment and bullying makes me skeptical of what his future contributions will be like. Has he had an epiphany in  [http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=User_talk:Mathoreilly&diff=485894&oldid=485890 the past 16 days] that should incline me to AGF to a greater extent with him than he did with the user in that link? (This line of thinking is largely courtesy of [[User:L'Aquatique]] above.) Perhaps, but the burden of proof is on Ed. And, yes, I know that Conservapedia is (nominally) a project distinct from Wikipedia. But I think there's a little more to RfA than simply trying to determine whether or not someone will abuse the tools. We're looking for an ''exceptional community member'' whose use of the tools, whose personality, etc. will combine to produce a very net-positive effect on both the content and the atmosphere of the project. I generally like to avoid opposition (see [[WP:NBD]] and [[WP:WTHN]]); I think that, in a community this big, there are thousands and thousands of potentially exceptional members. But, as [[User:Olin]] wisely implies above, perhaps we should be devoting our energy to helping some of the ''other'' folks among these thousands and thousands."

I particularly hate Speedy Deleters... while I recognize the need for them, I will only support the best of the best because IMHO a wreckless speedy deleter can be as harmful to the project as the most persistent vandal---and may never be noticed.  So I took a very close look at Euryalus, probably close to four hours (interspersed with watching the election results)!  I checked a large number of his AFD contributions, where he makes solid well rounded policy based persuasive arguments. I checked well over 100 of his CSD's... and while I caution him on the use of Patent Nonsense and *I* might have referred one or two to AFD, there weren't any that I felt were mistagged.  I also checked out his talk page---particularly looking for ""reverts"" or other signs of removing complaints.  Again, I would suggest carrying on conversations where they start and not jumping from page to page. I also looked at his other contributions.

He criticizes SandyGeorgia’s understanding of a prior exchange by stating:  ""Sandy, I want to work with you, but you are making it real hard. I make a living as an attorney, I don't take being accused of breaking my word lightly. Please withdraw what you said.""  When Sandy provided statements showing the basis for her understanding, the candidate made a legalistic argument why there was no agreement, stating the discussion ""does not constitute an agreement not to nominate for the 21st and I'm not buying that you viewed it that way"".  Inside of half an hour he took umbrage at what he took to be an attack on his honesty, while refusing to believe another editor’s statements, thereby impugning her honesty.   I am not comfortable with giving the powers of an administrator to someone who engages in argumentative behavior and who relies on his profession when advancing his position, nor with what appears to be an escalation of a misunderstanding rather than an attempt to resolve it.  (SandyGeorgia stated that the incident was ""no big deal"" even before Wehwalt made the second statement quoted above.)  While the two parties work well with each other, I am concerned of the effect of such actions on editors less experienced and collegial than Sandy Georgia."

EOTW, I am surprised that you would submit to RfA so soon after a FAC you submitted was archived because you google translated an article from the French wiki, without consulting the original sources while admitting that you don't read French. Your action on that FAC caused a lot of work for a lot of FAC reviewers; work that could have gone in to helping maintain and promote FA standards on other articles.  Understanding and respect for our core [[WP:V]] policy is fundamental to what we do here, and you show a great deal of immaturity to submit to an RfA nom (from someone who has been editing only two months, btw, where are the editors of long-standing repute who might nom you?) so shortly after this incident. ([[Wikipedia talk:Featured article candidates/1964 Gabon coup d'état/archive1#Closing rationale]]).  Adminship duties are not something to be approached impetuously: I hope you'll consider withdrawing for now, and spend some time in dedication to serious editing and improving your track record at FAC (both in terms of nominations and in terms of supporting other FACs without engaging [[WP:WIAFA]]) before resubmitting.  You seem to be a person of pleasant disposition; if I see a solid respect for the featured article processes from you in the future, I would likely support, but spurious Support declarations at FAC and ill-prepared noms create an extra burden for editors who strive to maintain FA standards and shows a lack of maturity or understanding of the seriousness of our [[WP:V]] policy.   Of course, there remains a large concern about what research you did on the DYKs and GAs you racked up, whether you consulted the sources on them, or whether you also google translated them from other Wikis without verifying sources.  I'm concerned that your article editing might have comprised the integrity of more than one article. At a time that a task force should be evaluating all of your past contributions for compliance with [[WP:V]], it is stunning that you would submit to the scrutiny of an RfA, which shows that you don't understand the seriousness of what you did.

TenPoundHammer has the qualities an administrator should have, and he has shown just that in his areas of editing Wikipedia. TenPoundHammer shows he can be a good article writer also by looking at his fifteen [[WP:DYK]] entries and his two [[WP:GA]]s. I've also seen him around [[WP:AIV]], some [[WP:XFD]]s, significantly at AfD, [[WP:RFPP]], and a few times at [[WP:UAA]] which shows he will be good as an administrator in adminly areas to take care of most of the problems lurking about. Many of these subjects I've brought up can easily be seen by looking at [[Special:Contributions/TenPoundHammer|TenPoundHammer's contributions]]. TenPoundHammer can even clear the AfD back logs with his experience. I'm sure TenPoundHammer will be able to help update [[T:DYK]]. DYK is sometimes late on updating, and I'm sure TenPoundHammer will be around to update DYK on time. He probably knows how to update DYK by watching other administrators do it, and I'm sure he can do it himself and having access past that protected DYK template. He has had seven RfAs I believe? In his last RfA, I believe he has cleared all the problems brought up by the opposers and has certainly improved on them now.

Protonk,Cyclonenim,1,-1,2008,"16:25, 17 July 2008","'''Support''' Opposes are unconvincing to me.  Misapplying CSD categories by accident is pretty bottom of the barrel, as are short, tentative AfD nominations (note that the article in the diff provided below was basically [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ross_Golan_and_Molehead|snow deleted]].  So all the diff shows is that the editor was not verbose.  The diff does not show that the editor introduced a bad faith nomination (a problem for me) or a nomination based on unreflected ignorance (another big problem for me).  Reflected ignorance is ok.  I couldn't care less about [[John_Handcock#Famous_signature|how big his signature is]].  I also see nothing wrong with [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/吴国|this nomination]].  '''NOTHING'''.  Administrators may be ignorant of some of the hundreds of non-admin projects here.  The claim made in the nomination (""Definitely wrong project, not sure if it's notable for inclusion in a foreign project since I can't read this language."", [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/%E5%90%B4%E5%9B%BD&oldid=226017146 hist]) is perfectly acceptable.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E5%90%B4%E5%9B%BD&oldid=226017141 This] was the page in question.  How, if ''you'' saw that string of text as an article, would you react?  All of the text (along with the title) is non-english.  Certainly if you know which language it was and which project could take care of it, you cold send it there, but why is CSD (and later AfD) an inappropriate choice?  And why, if it ''is'' an appropriate choice, is the wording somehow improper.  All in all, it seems to be making mountains out of molehills."

Bilby,Editorofthewiki,0,-1,2008,"02:10, 29 September 2008","'''Neutral'''. I was inclined not to comment, but as the candidate asked to see if anything positive could come of this: my major concern when this started was that Editorofthewiki seemed to be saying that there were problems in the past, but these wouldn't recur in the future. This seemed to be inherent in the answer to question 3, with the incredibly low requirements for recall (if ""one user in good faith thinks I messed up ...""). The problem from my perspective is that this is about trust, as judged on past behaviour. Thus what I really want to see is not ""I messed up, but I promise not to do it again"", or even ""If I mess up it will be easy to remove me"", but a demonstration of ""I messed up in the past, but learnt from that and ''haven't'' done it again"". Time is the only thing that will help with this. (Well, time and careful editing, I suppose). My initial concerns were then supported with the behaviour in this RfA. It is a stressful process, and this one must be particularly stressful for the candidate, but being an admin is likely to bring stress as well. Thus responses such as that made to Sandstein (""Never do it again""), don't show a good response to the stress, while the response to Promethean, ""It's not karma, its just that RFA is so f***ed up that people fail to recognise how effective I would be as an admin"" suggest something similar (along with, perhaps, a degree of arrogance which won't help the case). Similarly, I don't think that the candidate really understood Badger Drink's concern - it doesn't matter whether or not the apology was given, but the process of saying, effectively, ""I'll only vote for you if you give me an apology"" is the wrong attitude. Anyway, I'm certainly not convinced that Editorofthewiki will never make a good admin, but focusing on good, civil editing for a while will do a lot to address many of the concerns raised in the RfA. -"

SWik78,Philosopher,-1,1,2008,"14:32, 2 May 2008","'''Reluctant oppose''' I think criticism is a good thing as long as it's constructive. I find, however, that a large portion of criticism directed at the candidate (I speak of criticism about candidate's answer to Q4, the religious statement made on the user page and the self-nomination) has nothing constructive about it and I find it just shameful at how many people have taken the opportunity to take a jab at you without telling you what it is that you could have done in order to avoid such scrutiny. Some criticism has been constructive but a large portion of it seems to boil down to ''I don't like you'' and that bothers me quite a bit. For that reason I abstained from voting here until now because I didn't want my vote to look as another insult/injury directed at you due to a belief that if you do something differently than I would, you're wrong and you need to be punished. Having said that, I oppose your nomination at this time strictly due to your lack of recent activity. Prior to March of 2008, you only made 80 edits to Wikpedia within the last 7 consecutive months. I don't think you're a terrible candidate for an administrator at all and I actually commend you for nominating yourself for adminship especially if you had any kind of an idea as to how ideologically opposed some people are to that and you still had the nerve to go ahead and nominate yourself. Given a few more months of the level of activity you had during March and April, I would vote support on your next attempt at adminship, especially if you're brave enough to nominate yourself again."

There was a recent uploading of [[:Image:Ryan giggs.jpg]] which was deleted as a copyright violation. The user rarely uses edit summaries.

But here's what I've got so far. Indeed, there have been a few questionable reports to UAA, but he has a lot of reports there and a vast majority are fine. However, I do have to question his experience a bit. Indeed he has been around for eleven months longer than I have, but he has only 2300 edits. Now don't get me wrong, that's quite a bit and it ''is'' above the 2000 threshold that I normally like to see, so I tried to delve deeper into his experience. I found that his edit count might actually not be a very good indicator of what his actual experience is. His edit count is kind of bloated, with sometimes a whole lot of quick, consecutive edits to one place, such as nine consecutive edits to [[Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/Mantanmoreland/Proposed decision‎]] on February 29th, or four edits to [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Cabals]] in a two minute span, or eight consecutive edits to [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/RyanLupin 2‎]] on June 28th. But, on the other hand, based on the content of his contributions, he appears to be quite experienced and knowledgeable (at least from what I've seen so far).

The answer to Q7 confirms this weakness. Unlike registered users, IPs are virtually ''never'' indef-blocked.

I frequently close them on this basis, but not on this basis alone. If others can delete pages, that are not backed by current policy or guidelines, then others can keep based on good old fashion [[WP:COMMONSENSE|rationale]].</blockquote>  The clear implication was that, despite being told otherwise by multiple editors, he still believed that the MfD in question was ""frivolous, out of place, out of order, or in bad faith.""

My issue with the answer transcends adminship or even the wiki; giving up instead of learning new things when changes warrant such learning is a bad approach to have in life. Instead of becoming familiar with the new Good Article criteria and becoming a better reviewer (which GA desperately needs, judging by the now-commonplace backlogs), you close up shop. I also remember a few discussions with Mitch where he had an opinion regarding some XFDs but refused to add his opinion to the pages, which to me comes across as a bad practice as well - if you have an opinion about something, you have to voice it. No one on the wiki can read your mind. To me, an admin - to be honest, all editors as well - has to be willing to stand up to new challenges and be willing to voice their opinion. There are also a few flaws that I see on the editing side, but these are far too ticky-tack for this venue. Don't get me wrong, Mitch has done great things on-wiki and he's a good guy, which keeps me from opposing, but the concerns that both I and others have above are far too great in my mind to support at this time. --"

As a matter of fact, I had a several month period in which my activity dropped to a similar level, and I called it a wikibreak. So, I would urge ramping up the activity level by about 30X. I'm hard pressed to find any article building. Article building knowledge does carry over in wielding the mop. I see few edits beyond RFA's and AN/I over the last couple of months, so I would suggest a gaining much more experience at CSD, XFD, and Username's. Cheers,"

Sourcing is paramount for an encyclopedia, and an admin candidate should know this. I would like to see more article building experience-- especially taking the effort to source any articles candidate works on. The candidate must know where the information comes from, and should put the references in the articles.  I think taking the time to review our basic policies would be in order. The CSD work almost persuaded me. There needs to be more of that and the rest of the admin tool areas. I believe the candidate will be ready for the mop in about 6 months/5000 edits if the advice given in this RFA is heeded. Also, it's important to search for verifiability and reliable sources before deleting articles. Sometimes we delete articles about notable subjects that should be kept and would be with adequate sourcing and a well written lead."

Having said that I strongly encourage him to seek additional help if he passes, even if it's just a long-time respected administrator he can go to for tough questions.  I also strongly encourage him to stay out of areas where he is not very confident of relevant policies.  If he fails, I strongly encourage him to either self-study or continue at least minor coaching and spend the next few months editing as if he were already an administrator.  ""Editing as if we are an administrators"" is something every editor should be doing anyway, as all editors should be editing ""for the good of the project"" not any other reason.

While I am notably concerned over his ability to be neutral in political articles outside the relative confines of political conservative articles, he does allow for his own mistakes and never forces his beliefs on others. I am also concerned that he hasn't a lot of experience outside his article comfort zone, but then, as we aren't being paid, we are better off sticking to what we like. I would suggest that Happy's interest in RFPP and MfD successfully sidesteps this concern. If he makes an editorial call in an article in concerning American politics, it wold be expected that he consult other admins for guidance before doing so.  Personally, I disagree with him is virtually every discussion I have had with him concerning content, but he is one of those rare individuals who can keep matters civil. Poking at him for forgetting to log off his account, thereby inadvertently allowing an apparently juvenile person to act as him, is unfair. What was missed in the criticism was that these lapses in his typical demeanor were ''immediately'' noted when they occurred, for the simple reason that they were so unlike how HappyMe22 usually edits. It was a mistake, as no one typically expects a family member to screw them over. That Hap should log off his account when using a community computer is a lesson he has no doubt severely learned (and, if I remember my own interactions with my own brother, the appropriate level of payback administered). It isn't a reason to fault his ability to act appropriately. I think he should be monitored for a bit, as all new admins are, but he is ready for the mop, to my reckoning. -"

My cautiousness is that Q1 seems a little bland, you've not had much ''recent'' input regarding speedy tagging, and I saw a mass of vandal reverts on the 16th May, some of which were not really clear cut vandalism [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Islam&diff=prev&oldid=206040722] and '''none''' of which seemed to result in you warning the editor.

Balloonman,Mastrchf91,-1,-1,2008,"03:30, 15 May 2008","'''Weak Oppose''' I liked your answers, I really did.  But then I was surprised by your lack of meaningful contributions.  First there is user talk space.  You've only made 15 edits on your own talk space and that is the user talk where you've made the most contributions.  There are two other users where you've made more than 10 contributions.  Besides those 3 pages, there is not a single talk page (whether User, Wikipedia, Mainspace, or Template) where you've made more than 7 edits.  This tells me that you don't discuss issues with people and have little to no experience developing consensus.  It also shows that your understanding of policies and guidelines is strictly up to your interpretation---you've not discussed them to ensure that your position is consistant with the broader wiki community.  Your contributions to Wikipedia space is almost non-existant as well.  There are only five pages where you've made more than 10 edits---3 of them are related to The Office.  As a vandal fighter, I would expect more edits to AIV than 17. Second, most of your user talk space seems to be centered around the Office Newsletter and sending out a confirmation request.  Or it is automated via twinkle.  I saw very little that was personalized.  Third, and this really is kind of minor, while I liked the participation in CfD's (its nice to see a change from AfD) I saw a lot of ""Per nom"" !votes---which actually caused me to laugh when I read [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2008_April_27&diff=prev&oldid=208524586 this!]  I want to see how you react and interact with others before I give you the tools."

Acalamari,Ironholds,-1,-1,2008,"01:57, 11 October 2008","Well, I congratulate Ironholds for being bold to test a new RfA format, but I have some reasons to oppose this request. To begin with, I came across [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Tutthoth-Ankhre&diff=prev&oldid=237738524 this oppose] which, in my opinion, was incredibly biting, as were [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/HappyCat12&diff=prev&oldid=232382762 these] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Borgarde&diff=prev&oldid=235634923 two]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Everyking_4&diff=prev&oldid=234564028 This oppose], like a couple of the ones I mentioned above, was unnecessarily uncivil. I also came across a few other opposes that came across as aggressive in tone and/or lack the assumptions of good faith on behalf of the said candidates: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Islaammaged126_5&diff=prev&oldid=229101527][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/MrKIA11&diff=prev&oldid=228824923][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Derfboy&diff=prev&oldid=227875883] I'm also not happy with an event surrounding Ironholds' last RfA: two weeks prior to it, he [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Izzy007_2&diff=prev&oldid=215249287 tells another editor to wait to be nominated, and that is what he (Ironholds) was planning to do], yet he goes against his own advice and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Ironholds&diff=prev&oldid=218201928 self-nominates]: I do not consider that to be good judgment. On top of my other concerns, I have two more: I came across [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AIronholds&diff=220374008&oldid=220334107 this], an inappropriate hidden comment on his user page, and is still on his user page as of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3AIronholds&diff=229852298&oldid=225894980 most recent edit] (note that the most recent edit may change during the course of this RfA). Lastly, note in the first part of how I congratulate Ironholds for running in an experimental RfA? Well, ''I still do'' congratulate him, but I noticed part of his reasons for opposing two other candidates, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Ali%27i&diff=prev&oldid=219111868 Ali'i] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Mr._IP&diff=prev&oldid=229634944 Mr. IP]: in Ali'i, he mentioned, ""''In addition, applying to prove a point makes a mockery of the process. Yes, admins are technically no more important than users, but RfA in a way shows the quality and quantity of your contributions to Wikipedia; debasing that to prove a point is almost disruptive.""'': the RfA for Ali'i was somewhat of an experimental one, and Ironholds partially opposed her on that basis. As for Mr. IP, I found that more worrying; Ironholds' entire rationale was: ""''Oppose. This RfA does nothing but disrupt the process and create DRAMAH. If you want to test the RfA policy then you can contribute to the discussions about overhauling it, not waste peoples time here. By posting this RfA as a ""test"" you've proven yourself an inappropriate admin candidate.''"" That oppose was uncivil, which was bad enough, and now that Ironholds himself is running in a ""test"" RfA, after accusing two other people of “disruption” and/or “DRAMAH” for doing the same/similiar thing, and he has not followed his own words. Suffice to say, I am not comfortable with Ironholds' judgment for the time being."

I was hoping to get some statement of understanding from the candidate at how the guidelines, when followed without common-sense interpretation, lead to the unnecessary loss of good contributions, and how this leads to a sense of frustration and futility among contributors to articles on non-traditional subjects. The candidate seems to prefer to stick to the ""rules"" regardless of whether good content and good contributors are lost in the process. But this seems to be current Wiki-consensus. I actually find his disagreement with Wiki-blocking rules to be encouraging. Clearly destructive, incivil and arrogant editors are too often allowed to continue and prosper here. At least one such editor has even played the game well enough to gain Adminship. In this case, the editor was desysopped, yet continue disrupting repeatedly to this day when he should have been perma-blocked long ago (in my opinion). This leniency towards disruptive behavior coupled with an overly harsh and skeptical view of contributions outside of the mainstream, also, I feel, leads to the loss of good editors. It would be petty and arbitrary to oppose Morbidthoughts' Adminship because I personally think the guidelines which he closely follows have gone beyond the point of being helpful ""guides"" they are meant to be when applied equally to all subjects. But I can neither with a clear conscience support a candidate who supports guidelines with which I have such strong disagreement. Morbidthoughts: Don't let the growing ""Oppose"" section discourage you. Keep working on articles (though this has really has very little to do with winning an AfD, it does make a ''good'' Admin in my book), polish up the stock answers-- Your nominator can help you here, I'm sure :-) -- and I'm sure you'll breeze through a second RfA with flying colors."

[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rogers Orchards|This]] and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bruce McAbee|this]] caught my eye; 3) Canvassing such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:NYScholar&diff=234578016&oldid=234455527] where you say ""if you feel I am correct, feel free to jump in"" or in other words, ""please come and support me"", is frowned upon; 4) I find a candidate needing to respond to [nearly] every oppose vote very annoying and would likely oppose on that basis alone.

Martijn is brave enough to try and sort out the perpetual mess on [[WP:PAW|PAW-related articles]]. This is something I once tried and gave up on because it is so draining and because editors such as SqueakBox demand nothing short of full compliance with the idea that the number one priority is not neutrality but the destruction of any hint of satisfaction for people sympathetic to paedophilia. I'd encourage people to read carefully the diffs presented below by <s>Harland1</s> RegentsPark (sorry, wrong attribution in my original post). They are far from scandalous. They are trying to return a heated discussion toward basic principles: state the facts, trust the reader's moral judgement for the interpretation of these facts (the good ol' principle that we don't need to write ""Hitler was a bad guy"" for people to understand that he is). It's important to remember that a remorseless paedophile will get a hard-on when reading the articles on paedophilia, no matter how we phrase them. It's just as important to remember that, yes, activists sympathetic to paedophilia do routinely try to push their agenda on Wikipedia. But the only way to obtain quality articles on these delicate subjects is to involve more people like Martijn who, unless I'm missing some dramatic evidence, is not there to push any agenda beyond the Wikipedia agenda of responsible, sound editing. To see his courageous involvement belittled by petty insinuations saddens me."

What's more, he flatly refuses to recognize minor changes that would make him an exceptional candidate. His thread in the neutral section below with Dan is particularly disturbing. In particular his boast of not suffering fools... the very concept is entirely subjective, and though he seems to be throwing it around for dramatic impact, it displays a rash, immature approach to other editors that would not be suitable. Not only must an admin suffer fools, but also, an admin must contantly question whether or not they are themself the fool. That this debate is transpiring in his actual RfA, rather than off the cuff at some distant, more irrelevant point in the past leads me to oppose. I would say that I would support in the future, but as Malleus has already strongly indicated no reason to grow or change, then I see no reason to reconsider him in the future.

I trust that if an admin sees something that needs to be done, and finds himself interested enough to want to try, that he'll LEARN how to do it. People are not static entities--neither are admins.

Here's why. This is an encyclopedia, not an online Multiplayer where the good guys get to zap some bad guys and get rewarded with ""promotion"". Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a hierarchical MP-gaming  stroke social networking site. I'm being a little frivolous and unfair, I admit it, so I'll give a decent reason for an oppose. What the answer to question 6 missed and what no-one among the support votes pointed out is that the long community vote which gave sysops the right to block for 3RR a few years ago did not give sysops the right to preside over other users (admins or not) like little emperors anytime they chose. I may venture to say that that comment could make half the supports begin wikilawyering at me ... well, don't bother. ;) An open-ended expansionist philosophy of admin powers is enough to get my oppose, wikilawyering aside. Moreover, the user has ambition to intervene in content disputes and patrol 3RR, and despite very little experience with article building, has strong opinions about how such things ''ought'' to work out. I get the feeling it's a lot easier to parrot pontifications about how people ''ought'' to act in a content dispute than actually learn how these work, and this from what I can see is what DeadEyeArrow is doing. The user has little experience with article building, so I've gotta wonder where DeadEyeArrow gets the belief that he has more knowledge about these situations than an experienced admin article builder like Dbachmann? ""Another content-shy self-righteous intervenionist mandarin with blocking powers"" is what I might be tempted to predict were I in a worse mood ... but even the hint of this is not what this encyclopedia needs just now. To DeadEyeArrow, 45 supports to 0 opposes suggest you have more good qualities than bad, so my oppose is no more than a little balancing. You're already pretty much guaranteed to go through, so good luck and I hope you prove me to be a pessimist."

You clearly understand the policies that apply to the areas you work in. Incidentally, my understanding of current policies is that list-type articles are allowed to contain redlinks, because they encourage others to create articles to turn the redlinks blue. If the redlinks bother you, you can link it to something else. Have a look at my articles [[Agro-]] or [[Aggi]] for some examples.

Unfortunately, after several failed RFAs which have been sunk by this same issue, it has become apparent that Hammer is a leopard who can't change his spots. Even some of his supporters have advised him to be cautious with the delete button if he passes, but there's little hope of that: he hasn't been able to take the advice he has been given in past RFAs to heart, and his answer to Q1 proclaims, ""The work I plan to participate in the most is deletion work."" Note that my main problem is with hastiness, more than deletionism ''per se'' - the candidate can also point to articles he has saved, nor is he the most unreasonable person once a discussion gets going. Also, no one seems to be questioning his snowball keeps lately, so maybe he has improved on that score - if he has, it may have ironically made him seem more deletionist.

Sorry, Wehwalt, I normally like to support article builders at RfA, but I regard this sort of lying and inconsistent application of rules as an automatic and absolute bar to adminship or any other position of trust.

However, Hesp made him aware that the MoS did not support his edit in  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Hesperian&diff=prev&oldid=207519008 this reply] on VT's talk page.  After Hesp explained this to him, he reverted [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Goat&diff=prev&oldid=207521932 four] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=European_Rabbit&diff=prev&oldid=207522140 more] of [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dromedary&diff=prev&oldid=207522295 Hesp's] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cat&diff=prev&oldid=207522754 edits], before [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style&diff=prev&oldid=207523231 changing the MoS] to agree with him.

When he realized that [[WP:MoS]] did not support his edits, he changed the policy to agree with him!  We have too many admins that do that sort of revisionist history now, I do not think we need another; additionally, I believe his approach to Hesp's oppose here comes off as confrontational. Combine that with the old civility concerns raised at his [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/VanTucky|previous RfA]] and what I perceive as an [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Giovanni_di_Stefano&diff=prev&oldid=206793786 insensitivity] to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Angela_Beesley_%286th_nomination%29&diff=prev&oldid=138471396 BLP problem], I must oppose.  Allow me to explain the BLP concerns:  In the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Giovanni_di_Stefano&diff=prev&oldid=206793786 Stefano diff] he chides others for their lack of ""cojones"" for voting delete and in the (admittedly old) [[Angela Beesley]] AfD, he suggests that if you do not want to be a public figure, then you should just remove yourself from a position of public scrutiny and ""grow the fuck up"".[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Angela_Beesley_%286th_nomination%29&diff=prev&oldid=138471396].  We need admins that are sensitive to the BLP issue--these two diffs show a person who does not consider the affect that these articles have on real life people.  He felt this way in June 2007 and feels similarly now, it seems.  Respecting the subjects of our bios does not include telling other editors to ""get cojones"" or telling article subjects to ""grow the fuck up"".  In conclusion, admitting when you made a mistake, being humble and polite about it, and apologizing when one screws up are skills that an admin needs--the recent events here suggests he does not have these skills.  My concerns over his feelings on BLPs and his civility in general is what caused me to watch this RfA; this incident with Hesp just confirms the bad feelings I had about him being an admin."

I'm not convinced that the candidate as adequate grasp of ''and acceptance of'' the relevant policies to trust with the ''undelete'' button. It is unusual for this to be the problem. There is no doubt in my mind that the candidate would not delete items that should be kept, and I would support a limited use as proposed for images, but I see little activity in image deletions. Furthermore, while it was made long ago, I find this edit to a later deleted image troubling-- ""''While any rational human being could figure out that a scan of a video game's box would be fair use in an article about that video game.

I'm in a similar boat as [[User:Tiptoety|Tiptoety]] (down in neutral), even though (no offense, Tiptoety) I ''really'' don't want to be there. I think [[User:TenPoundHammer|TenPoundHammer]] is an excellent editor and a tremendous asset to Wikipedia, which is why I'm in support, but I'm somewhat concerned with a few things I found in contribs, which is why I'm tentative in that support. The AfDs mentioned in oppose do not concern me, especially as in a number of them the nominator withdrew the nomination once it was demonstrated to him that consensus was against him. I note that in the same period of time, he listed a number of mall articles for AfD that ''were'' accordingly deleted by consensus: [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shoppes at Blackstone Valley|1]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/University Mall (Pensacola, Florida)|2]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Marina Square Center|3]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Compton Fashion Center|4]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Wayne Hills Mall|5]] and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Uniontown Mall|6]], to name a few among the many. It's not like the nom is working to delete articles on former English kings, here—there is obviously legitimate need for discussion over what renders a mall notable and what does not. However, I've gone through his recent contributions (deleted and otherwise) with an eye for locating mistagged speedies, since I think those are probably a better indicator of misuse potential, and I do have ''some'' misgivings about some of those, particularly in [[WP:CSD#A1]] territory. A1, no context, is for articles that cannot be comprehended because there is insufficient material in them to parse what they're about. This seems obviously to me not to apply to the following: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Summer_Spins_EP&diff=181127812&oldid=181123415 1], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marco_Island_Town_Center&diff=178436039&oldid=172977457 2] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parties&diff=prev&oldid=173193528 3]. ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Product_Market&diff=174153664&oldid=174153263 This one] is hardly a stellar example of an article stub, but it was tagged 2 minutes after creation—surely not enough time to allow the creator to establish the article? I tend to think it might be better to watchlist an article in such a case and come back to it later.) Also, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Made_in_London&diff=174976913&oldid=174976166 this A7 nom] is concerning given that the article asserts a charted hit. The fact that half an hour later, after the speedy was declined, nom admitted ""didn't catch that, they have charted a hit"" in the [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Made in London|AfD]] doesn't reassure me. We ought to read the ''whole'' article before !voting for delete, much less tagging for speedy deletion. :( So, given these misgivings, why am I in support? I've thought for a long time about it. I feel very confident in his work overall. I do not believe he will willfully abuse the tools, and these indicators of potential misuse are '''very small''' in proportion to his overall contributions. He is overall very familiar with policy, and given his obvious desire to work within guidelines and to seek consensus, I believe that once an issue is pointed out to him, he will work in good faith to correct it. Still, while he says above that ""lately, I've been making sure to think twice (or even three times) before I act"" in terms of deletions, one of those A1s was placed on 12/31 and that unread A7 was only a month ago. I would ''really'' like to be an enthusiastic supporter of this RfA, but can't without some additional assurance that he's going to be careful with deletions to apply policy properly and to thoroughly evaluate candidates before deciding that an article should go. --"

He was quite correct that the now deleted edit would be evaluated as vandalism by any editor who had no reason to suspect otherwise, but his handling of this situation leads me to suspect that more time in admin-related areas would improve his ability to deal with the varied situations that admins encounter. More project space contributions and more dialog with other editors seem like valuable preparation for adminship here to me.

Reason I can't support is due to both maturity issues and specific photo copyright issues discussed above. The reason I'm not logging in a long oppose is because I've felt that MFC has been deceived by the community as to what constitutes a prepared admin. No one individual did it deliberately or with maliciousness, but collectively it appears MFC was led to believe that adminship can be aquired through x edits in y areas, and the whole concept of deep maturity along with the ability to handle tough situations was left to the wayside. He did was he was told, but was never told that maturity can't automatically be gained by spending a couple months doing featured lists and reporting some people to AIV. MFC - if you ever get around to reading this whole RfA, please ''do not'' set your next goal as passing RfA 5 (6?). I wont say wait 3 months, or 6 months, or a year, because I don't know when you will be ready, and frankly it's unfair to keep telling candidates to wait x amount of time when frankly we don't know when they will be ready. All I'll say is ''wait'', stop worrying about being an admin to the extent that's possible, and in due time you'll be ready, whether thats 3 months or 3 years."

I think an admin should be able to use CSD tags correctly, although of course I know he might have acted in good faith.

Of course that does not make a oppose reason by itself but it gives me the impression that TPH is eager to delete first and ask questions (or consensus) later, which ''might'' well result in a large number of articles who actually were not eliglible for CSD to be deleted. I think his work at XfD is without any question great and much needed but I simply feel that he should not be the one actually deleting things. Also, I am not comfortable with his answer to Q6 because his example contradicts current articles: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MARRS&oldid=116255296 This bands article] was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MARRS&diff=128601319&oldid=128601253 redirected (i.e. deleted and redirected)] to [[Pump Up the Volume (song)]] which is in fact notable even if the band was not.

If anything, I'd rather have admins which are reluctant to delete articles, especially in the speedy deletion category: too many things are being speedy deleted beyond what the guidelines prescribe. Besides, I don't understand how the candidate's comments can be misconstrued as divisive. Let's face it: there ''are'' differences in the way various users approach deletion. You can say ""my own threshold for what should be included is above average"" or you can say ""I'm a deletionist"" as a shortcut. Bottom line is that if you're willing to accept that things that you wish were kept/deleted are being deleted/kept, this is not a problem.

Anyone deleting material should understand the perspective of someone creating it.

Yet if you look at his last 3500 edits (which takes you back to December) you will find that he has only participated in roughly 8 XfD's.  The ones that he did participate in are almost exclusively related to Oregon (eg he likely came to the debate through the wikiproject he belongs too.)

That must indicate some sound policy knowledge. There is ''some'' article work, and relevant discussions on how to move articles forward.

But a surprising number of those articles that are tagged are not deleted.  This leaves me very concerned about giving her the tools when one of her stated reasons is something she doesn't have much experience with.  Then there is the complete lack of experience in areas outside of wrestling.  There is nothing that shows she understands wikipedia policies and guidelines.

I think there is a bit of attraction toward drama for Lawrence (and in that regard Edison's advice in support-vote-thingy-72 above to ""seek to diminish drama, and abandon the need to 'have the last word'"" is particularly useful), however I think he is drawn toward contentious situations because he truly cares about the project and feels he has good ideas about how to advance it.

Surely addressing the concerns of the community with logic and brevity is better than arguing about what ""isn't really a rule"".

MastCell,Coppertwig,-1,-1,2008,"20:53, 7 May 2008","'''Weak oppose''': Let me start by saying the following: Coppertwig is one of the most genuinely civil and pleasant editors I've encountered. He's a good example of what [[WP:CIVIL]] ''should'' mean in practice, and an excellent role model for editors striving to remain civil on controversial topics. He's made very solid encyclopedic contributions. I also have a great amount of respect for all 3 of his nominators and their judgement. I think a number of the opposes above are a bit harsh or unfair. But I still feel compelled to list myself under this column.<br>Yes, it's mostly the Iantresman thing. Coppertwig wrote: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACoppertwig&diff=206393510&oldid=206382580 ""I support unblocking Iantresman, on the grounds that the user has apparently done nothing wrong, unless complaining about injustice against himself is considered disruptive.""] Iantresman wasn't blocked because he held minoritarian opinions; he was blocked because he placed the promotion of those opinions above Wikipedia's policies and the goal of creating a respectable and serious encyclopedia. The inability to perceive a distinction between those two propositions is concerning. As is the idea that someone reveiwing Iantresman's history would conclude that he'd done ""nothing wrong"" beyond justifiably complaining about injustices. This is relevant because as an admin, your decision to unblock someone (or support for their unblock) carries quite a bit of weight, and I'm not comfortable at this point that Coppertwig is going to make good decisions in that arena.<br>That's just me - I'm one person and that's my personal opinion. This is a regretful oppose, because as I said I think Coppertwig does a lot of things very well and I hope he continues to be a prolific contributor and a role model for dealing with thorny disputes, but then you don't need to tools to do those things, and I'm not comfortable enough to support the additional buttons right now. I hope Coppertwig will consider this in the spirit in which I'm writing it, regardless of whether the RfA passes or not. '''"

But I got the impression early on that this RFA would be convoluted at best. And tonight (although made earlier) I see from the candidate ''""I understand the opposers, I just don't think they ""get me"" the way I had hoped""'' as a statement from the candidate. Yep, well I'm afraid communication in a text only medium is damn hard. In fact, part of the reasons my first RFA passed was myself poorly communicating what I thought was funny and insightful when others felt it was sarcastic and bitey. '''However''' admins need to be able to communicate efficently and clearly. The fact you may not use the tools is immaterial to this argument - there are many searches on Wikipedia that would identify you as having +sysop - and indeed at near the top of the list given your username. So - the subjective crunch - Do '''''I''''' feel confident in you being able to use admin tools to the standards the community expects if it was asked of you, and could you do this effectively without issue and with effective communication? - '''No'''. Do I believe that you would deny flat out any request for use of the tools, thus mitigating my proposition? - No. Hence oppose.

While admins have acquired the status of village elders, this status can also be acquired by non-admins of character and individual strength.

Creating drama, being of strong opinions spoken forcefully with little respect for discourse, and having uncertain temperament are three qualities that should automatically rule out anyone from being an admin. Having a powerful mind, coupled with a passionate commitment to the project are qualities great for the village elder speaking at meetings, but are not needed for complying with a community request which the admin doesn't personally agree with.

Having worked for a politician in real life, I know what canvassing is, and leaving a few polite, neutrally-worded messages on talk pages isn't it. Yes, I know that in theory such notification skews the sample, but I don't think this is seriously problematic. Those editors who have worked with a candidate before are those who are most qualified to judge that candidate's fitness for adminship - and experience has shown that they don't all necessarily vote Support. We would only have cause to worry if candidates were stacking the vote by recruiting armies of supporters who shared their own ideological viewpoints, and that is not happening; besides, any candidate who was dishonest and power-hungry enough to do that would probably not do it openly on-wiki. So all in all, I don't think that the alleged ""canvassing"" is a sound reason to oppose.

On a browse through his contribution history, I can't see him ''ever'' believing that an article should be deleted. Given that his mainspace history seems to consist entirely of reversions (I went through the last 4000 mainspace contributions and there's ''not a single edit'' other than reversions and AFD closures), and his user talk history consists entirely of boilerplate warnings, there are no quality article-space contributions or thoughtful talkpage discussions to counterbalance my feeling that this is an editor who just doesn't understand what the purpose of Wikipedia is. I'm also very put off by ""I would also delete pages meeting the criteria for speedy deletion encountered in newpage patrol"" - while I appreciate that a lot of admins do things that way, deleting things without a second opinion, except in th most clearcut cases, seems dubious to me, especially from a new admin.

So would you guys support the accountless IP addresses for adminship too? <br> but seriously, claiming other peoples work as your own is really low; using their work to give yourself undeserved admin tools - down right rotten.

I also do not believe candidates need to have experience in all admin areas. We volunteer to edit here, adminship is all the same. I came into adminship with ZERO XfD experience. I closed a few AFDs on request one day, totally effed it up, reverted it all back and stayed away until I felt like dipping my toe in again. Did them all right that time, but still don't much care for it. And that's fine. We need all the help we can get, and the oppose section of this RFA examples pretty much every shameful vote that shows how broken this process has become. From POINTy opposes that disregard the candidate completely, to those that conflict with tradition and a few that conflict with each other. The long standing ""one should not have to show a ''need'' for the tools"" has been chucked for this RFA. Last week everyone maintained, as it has been from the start, that ""adminship is no big deal"", but for this RFA it is now a big deal (which I've been saying for months, but now it's hitting the oppose section). Having a sense of humor is a show of poor judgment?! And now, apparently, if someone doesn't have as much time to spend on the project as others, their small amount of time is not as valuable. Why do we not want someone who makes 125 edits a month to devote even 12 of those edits to admin work? That's 12 less edits on the backlog each month. And what if he finds he enjoys a particular admin task and spends all of his 125 edits there, or maybe increases his involvement? Take what you can get in time and quantity when you're looking for free labor. Clearly, this RFA is beyond saving, but Plasticup has his heart in the right place, and he's working to improve the project with what little time he can. The beating people take in this pathetic process is horrible. He made a joke in his nom statement and he basically gets stoned for it. Like Kurt said, lighten up. It's the internet, this is just a website, and it was just a joke."

Yet since there are many people I respect opposing (as well as many people I respect supporting), I have carefully read through this RFA and examined more closely to see if I am swayed to oppose.  The only negative I see regarding Everyking occurred in the past--his excessive commenting on *everything* at AN to the point of annoyance, but that was dealt with, he improved, and I have no reason to think he would abuse admin tools, particularly since he never abused them in his first round as admin.  His very prolific content contribution on this project demonstrates dedication that I think outweighs any prior annoyances.  He understands policy, and while he may be opinionated, and at times borderline confrontational, he is not uncivil. Our community sometimes shuts out those perceived as critics, but it would be to the project's benefit to be more openminded and listening.   I think Everyking provides much-needed balance to our repertoire of admins. --"

I am a big supportor of mainspace work, since that is the whole reason we are here, but if you want to become an admin, you'll need to get experience in admin-like areas (such as AIV, ANI, UAA, etc. Plus you don't do a whole lot of communication, which is a critical skill for admins."

While their contributions to date have been very good, I don't like the idea of this candidate using the tools in a ""grievous situation"", and then making a mistake due to lack of practice / familiarity / policy knowledge. On a related note, posting a link to a policy page (Q6) is not a good response from an ''admin''; from a ''candidate'', it fails to demonstrate any understanding of policy. Perhaps the risk of awarding these tools is low; judging by the candidate's statements, the reward certainly should be. Given the uncertainty in risk/reward ratio, I can certainly see why community opinion is divided on this. On balance, I would rather not see tools being handed out to an editor who really doesn't care about either gaining or losing them.  <font color=""006622"">"
Toon05,MrKIA11,-1,-1,2008,"20:16, 30 July 2008","'''Oppose''' - your answers to some of the optional questions troubles me. Especially question 7 - permanent blocks for IPs are generally not required/recommended - according to [[WP:BLOCK]], ""IP addresses should rarely, if ever, be blocked indefinitely"", and this doesn't strike me as an exception. Also your response to the [[WP:CDB|CDB]] question is unsatisfactory. I feel that these questions reveal some lack of [[WP:POLICY|policy]] knowledge in some pretty important administrative areas. I'm sure that your heart is in the right place, I just think you need to learn the policies and guidelines much better, and I'd certainly have no problems considering afresh another RfA in a while.  -  <span style=""font-family:Hobo Std.; font-size:12px; "">'''"

Otherwise one of his conominators could have just nominated him.  Given the discussion about barnstars and so on, I would guess at meat puppetry, people trying to get awards. </s> Also, given the rather low edit count considering that most of these edits were quick and easy tagging, minor edits, I don't think the user knows what it truly is to edit.  I get the strong feeling that he doesn't want the mop to do actual work (and given the short length of thought made in posts, perhaps that's a good thing) but is rather trying to do this as a form of social promotion.

Soleil,Rudget,-1,1,2008,"05:18, 5 January 2008","I worry about this user's clue. For a while Rudget was a clerk at the rename board. While he did primarily good work, several of his comments were not helpful or wrong and indicated a lack of understanding of the rename process; he was contacted about this by three different people before he left a [[Wikipedia talk:Changing username/Assistance#Clerk Resignation|resignation note]]. When clerking at the rename board, it is important that the bureaucrats can trust that a clerk's comments are correct and relevant, otherwise the bureaucrats must check everything themselves, which defeats the purpose of having clerks. He volunteered his time at a place where it's important one understand what's going on, but he didn't fully. {{tlx|Rudget notice to readers}} should not have been in template space, (I pointed this out to him and he then userfied) which I also find alludes to a larger lack of wiki knowhow. A while back he closed [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of destinations served by Manchester Airport Terminal 1|these]] [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of destinations served by Manchester Airport Terminal 2|two]] AfDs as keep after commenting keep in them (they were ultimately relisted after a DRV and deleted). He says he didn't know that this was a procedural faux pas, and while that was almost certainly true, abstaining from closing discussions one has commented on is a huge deal in my mind, and the fact that he didn't know even that important aspect of the deletion process causes me to question the thoroughness of his policy knowledge. A similar problem was also exhibited on [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/WRNY (AM)|these]] [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/WRRC (FM)|two]], which were also [[Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2007 November 18|overturned at DRV]], although I can't find a relisting of them anywhere interestingly. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Usernames_for_administrator_attention&diff=next&oldid=182136252 He reported] a username at UAA (which means it is blatant and needs to be blocked right now), but quickly changed his mind after feedback from EVula. While it's good that he was able to understand he was wrong, if someone is going to report a user to be blocked quickly because of his username, he should be sure that his report is correct. His last RfA was also a bit over two months ago, and while waiting three months is not a steadfast rule, I appreciate when an editor can respect the community's norms; this isn't a huge deal though. Ever since being appointed to featured portal co-director, he has not given up a chance to make note of it (cf. Q2 and userpage). This seems to me as if he sees that this appointment (and therefore it is not unreasonable to assume he sees adminship this way) as a trophy. I'm also really confused about the answer to Q3 [[User:Rudget/AC#Round two|here]]. I assume that was written incorrectly; otherwise I think he may need to scale back his time here. [[User:Rudget/Contributions#Users I've helped to block|This]] is extremely distasteful, and my biggest concern. Blocking is not something we strive to do, and then wear a list of users we have gotten blocked as a badge of honor. Interestingly, at least one of those users has never been blocked before. It is these several lapses in judgment that, while none are particularly serious, (although I still cannot get over his ''Users I've helped to block'' list), that cause me enough concern about misuse (although not neccessarily ''abuse'') of the tools, as well as his attitude towards things if he were to become an admin.

Nick,Stormtracker94,-1,-1,2008,"02:17, 21 April 2008","'''Oppose''' This is going to be a long comment, so I'll apologise in advance. Firstly, I'm again surprised that the candidate is here at RfA, so very soon after the last RfA, which was just over a month ago. I made a comment on that RfA which prompted the candidate to withdraw the RfA and admit that accepting a nomination was a clear error of judgement, so I said I was happy to withdraw my comment and treat the RfA as a declined nomination, but we're back here at RfA after another month, now this is the 3rd request in 4 months and the second which has been accepted. I'm a little disappointed at the nominators, so I'll start there first, they're all fairly intelligent people who should really know that nominating a candidate a couple of months after their last RfA outing is likely to result in another failed request, so I'm at a loss as to what the hell they're doing. I can quite happily shout at candidates self nominate every other week, but when someone is being poked and prodded with nominations from users who really should know better, it's only natural they'll assume they do know better and are likely to accept a nomination. That doesn't absolve them of responsibility to determine whether they should be at RfA, and in that respect, I'm still not happy that Stormtracker94's judgement is up to scratch, especially when I told them to wait more than 5 or 6 weeks before accept another nomination. Potential administrators not listening or professing to listen then ignoring advice worry me. The deleted page about trying to change RfA (which again, I seem to have been the first to comment on) was, I feel, an indication that the user has an unhealthy interest in passing RfA, which on it's own isn't a bad thing, I don't care if someone who I feel would make a great administrator passes RfA after having a great deal of interest in it, but when it's someone who has recently failed one RfA and had a second withdrawn, mildly outwith process, as I was obviously in a very charitable mood that day, it starts to become rather troubling. I have a few concerns which I'll share, my first concern is [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AGiovanni_di_Stefano&diff=206973395&oldid=206954920 this] which is in no way sensible behaviour for any user, and it worries me immensely as to how such an attitude would impact on the project if the user was given access to the block, deletion and page protection tools. I'm also left wondering how much the user knows when it comes to the biographies of living persons policies and the role of OTRS volunteers within the project. I don't even see any evidence that the user even paid a cursory glance at the AfD, which Lawrence provides all the details of the situation they are asking for in the diff above. The deleted page detailing the new RfA process the candidate here wishes to propose again showed signs that the candidate had a impulsive response to something, and there's again no evidence they had looked at WT:RFA or were familiar with the subject of adminship reform. I believe I checked the users contributions at the time and saw no recent edits to WT:RFA, which I believe demonstrates an inability to communicate with interested parties on a subject. I'm a little concerned that I had to fix the comments of the user in their own RfA, they appear not to be able to correctly format wiki-markup, which is a tiny little problem, but admins have access to the MediaWiki namespace, blacklists and such, where a little error can prevent a spam filter or titleblacklist working, and I've just got the feeling it's indicative of an overall lack of experience - that's something difficult to quantify, but that's my thoughts. Finally, I'm unhappy with the candidate agreeing with the endless harassment of those Opposing above, that's jolly bad form and again begs the question how they would behave if given access to administrator tools."

These areas include [[WP:AIV]], [[WP:UAA]], [[WP:RFPP]], [[WP:XFD]], [[WP:AN]], and [[WP:ANI]]. Would like to see more activity in these areas. 3) You have quite a low edit summary usage. Administrators should explain themselves of why/what they are doing while making an edit so others know what an admin is doing. Would like to see you doing this as a non-admin also. 4) You do article writing, which is pretty good, but I think you should try promoting articles to [[WP:DYK]], [[WP:GA]], and maybe even [[WP:FA]] if you work hard at it. 5) I think a higher edit count with quality edits would be necessary here.

Synergy is someone I have a number of different problems with, none of which are ""killers"" in themselves, but which together add up to ""not enough to trust him"", and a general feeling (right or wrong) that this is someone who has an over-rigid ""policy is there to be enforced"" mentality, except when it applies to him. I've gone through every AfD contribution of his from the whole of August, and I can't find ''one single example'' of him saying anything other than ""keep"", aside from a single ""redirect"" [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Postville Raid|here]]; extreme inclusionism is all well and good, but there comes a limit. While (although I'd consider myself an inclusionist) I disagree with the hardline stance of, for example, [[User:DGG|DGG]], I trust DGG to weigh issues fairly when closing XfDs, and to be honest – given the number of times I've warned Synergy about his inappropriate non-admin closures – I don't trust him at AfD, which is the first place he says he specifically wants to work. Yes, these were in the past, but they weren't ""borderline"" decisions; these were outright [[WP:ILIKEIT]] decisions, most notoriously speedy-closing [[Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/User:Sharkface217/Awards Center|this MfD]] as ""keep"".

I cannot understand how ""Calling code +1-868 is the calling code of Trinidad and tobago"" fails to identify the subject of the article. Isn't it a [[calling code]] for [[Trinidad and Tobago]]? Tagging [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=EqWorld&diff=prev&oldid=201471355 this page] was also questionable. The web page has reliable sources and is mentioned in multiple books.

It's false that article writers have no need for the tools; whether it's a history merge, a semi-protection in case of heavy vandalism, deleting a self-uploaded fair-use image that will no longer be used in the article, or even auto-patrolling a new article, saving a new page patroller time, they are still simple tasks that can be done by a trusted article writer, instead of an editor solely dedicated to cleaning backlogs.

Anyways, I support sysopping iMatt because, to a large degree, he has already filled the role for some time. He's deserved the mop far longer than he realizes. His humility is what attracted me to him when he arrived on Wikipedia, and I watched him develop into a fantastic editor more quickly than almost any other editor who has arrived during my Wiki career. iMatthew will make a fantastic administrator; he will not only fill his role well, but bring honor to the title.

KellyAna does freely admit that she occasionally has trouble staying civil, but TPH's comments, calling her rude,[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Malinaccier&diff=prev&oldid=199957626] and justifying his own actions because he's ""out of sorts""[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:KellyAna&diff=prev&oldid=199949571] were the kind of thing that escalate a situation, not de-escalate it. Further, when KellyAna challenged his unsourced additions, TPH responded by placing a ""bad faith"" warning on KellyAna's talkpage,[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:KellyAna&diff=prev&oldid=199960299] asking ''her'' to supply a source that his information was incorrect.

The responsibility for providing a source is on the editor wanting to add the information, not the one wanting to remove it (and as it turned out, KellyAna was right and TPH was wrong).[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trace_Adkins&diff=prev&oldid=199961886]  And I am especially concerned that TPH was taking these kinds of actions during his RfA (when most people would know better than to get involved in something controversial such as an edit war or uncivil comments). It is essential that those who are seeking administrator access be able to set a good example of calm under pressure, and, if they're going to get involved in disputes, they need to show that they are the kind of people whose participation will ''de''-escalate a dispute, not escalate it.  But based on what I've seen today, I have to really wonder about TPH's judgment and ability to handle on-wiki stress.  As such, I'm sorry, but I cannot endorse this nomination. --"

As well as nominating the above mentioned high school for deletion, he also nominated [[Greenbrier High School|another]], which also has won multiple state championships in baseball guaranteeing multiple reliable sources.

I am worried that over-zealous application of his own deletion criteria may result in [[WP:BITE|biting ]] by deleting a newbie's article, without giving due consideration to wheter it meets CSD criteria or not. Given that these comments were made within the last 24 hours, makes me very uneasy and unable to support at this time."

I hadn't realised just how many discussions on subjects dealing with race have included his dubious involvement. As I mentioned in my ""neutral"" comment, I'm skeptical about his judgement, but I have two new points that have persuaded me to change my vote. The lesser point is that, in mentioning conflicts he had been involved in, Wikidudeman only cited the AAVE conflict, and not any others - not even quite recent/ongoing conflicts, leaving the impression that such events were well in the past. The more disturbing point is a profound contradiction: that Wikidudeman has worked strenuously over more than a year to restrict the inclusion of parapsychology, homeopathy and other pseudo-science content in Wikipedia (an orientation I can agree with), while at the same time working quite strenuously to include content from racist and deeply misguided sources as though they are on an equal footing with authoritative sources. Surely any ""information"" from ''Stormfront'' is of far less value to Wikipedia than the work of most homeopathy advocates... (The views of ''Stormfront'' have absolutely no relevance to the question of the ethnicity of the ancient Egyptians, for example.) Reviewing the David Irving discussions was both a reminder of the wretched AAVE saga, and a further confirmation that Wikidudeman doesn't or won't understand NPOV and its bearing on different kinds of sources. I still believe he is a much improved editor, but I can't believe that someone with such faulty judgement and perception would be a good administrator."

Quite a few times he has not properly interpreted policy, and this is a concern for me ... but I'm sure he will be more careful of this when he gets the mop. But above all he needs to develop a thicker skin. I'm serious here. ''Sometimes'' you need to think of wikipedians more as forces of nature than personalities, esp. when you become an admin, and to hold off a bit before becoming offended.

The result was a better-written, more tightly sourced passage which seemed to meet his objections. (At the time, I mistook Avruch for Avriham and I almost left a note on Avruch's page to say that now I'd twice had my prose edited by someone who had impressed me with the improvements. Since reading this page, I'm happy to find out what we have here is four hands on the keyboards rather than two.) I'm also impressed by Avruch having Lar as a mentor. I looked over Avruch's contributions, and I'm impressed by his cool, helpful comments in discussions. As others have said, he may show up a lot on some of our drama stages, but he's not there to ham it up (I saw a minor exception in one spot, but nobody's perfect; and, frankly, he keeps his cool much better than this non-admin does). He contributed a bit at the Mantanmoreland arb case, and I overall disagreed with what he said, but I can't question his judgment or his tone there. I didn't want to vote before seeing how he'd answer my questions above, and he answered them well, except for Question #11. What I wanted to see in that answer was whether he'd stand up even against a consensus if it went against policy. Even if there are 170 or so editors going one way, it's the closing admin's duty to go the other if that's the only way policy can be interpreted. That disappointment aside, this is clearly an editor knowledgeable about policy and procedures (from quite early on in his contributions, it seems), and one who pretty obviously has the maturity to be an admin. And thanks, Avruch, for quickly answering all those questions. I think you'll be a real asset to WP."

However, I would like to make a few comments. I think the diff JayHenry gave, while disturbing, is ultimately irrelevant. First, it is many months old, and we are all entitled to our own personal opinions about how things ''should'' be, but we are ultimately bound by policy and consensus. Second, I think it is twisting the comment to say that Kww was calling ''all'' editors who add fiction type of edits/articles ""vandals"". Kww explains this issue extremely well at the top of this page when discussing how s/he would handle closing AfDs (Q4). It doesn't matter what our personal feelings are, all that matters is the consensus. Additionally, in case nobody has noticed, this is an editor with a '''huge''' amount of experience with images. Kww probably knows more about the IUP and image issues than most administrators, and that's a giant area in need of experienced, knowledgeable admins. Take a look at the discussions he had [[User talk:Forever Kenny|here]], for an example. While it appears this RfA is not going to pass, I would strongly encourage everyone to realize that just because someone is passionate about topics, doesn't automatically mean they would be an impulsive administrator. Also, I would encourage Kww to continue the excellent work on images, and hopefully the next time, the community will recognize the value your experience would bring to that area in particular, and the passage of time will see the community support you for RfA. <small>"

I do not feel that the user is trusted to receive the tools in those regards.  I spent a good while reviewing the users contributions, and I agree with the above opposition reasons regarding the use of the website as an ''encyclopedia''.  Don't get me wrong, I've only ever written two articles and my interest in Wikipedia has always lay in relaxing and reading, many many many many more hours than my edit count would suggest so I'm certainly no ""Article Builder!"" opposer.  My issue is that the user has virtually no experience in dealing with users that they are unfamiliar with.  Looking over the User_talk contributions alone gave me caution- this place ''should'' involve dealing with the unfamiliar with regular use of the encyclopedia.  Heck, posting in Talk: space is what first motivated me to register my account.  Even warning vandals gives experience in how to handle the situations that were expressed in the answer to question one.  How can I trust someone to resolve an issue on the COIN when they have never dealt with COIN in starkness?  The answer to Q1 is a litany of duties that seems to me to be derived to please the audience.  Personal opinion, not a judgment call there.  I feel the user doesn't truly understand the principle of an administrator on Wikipedia.  This isn't a crown or status, it's a greatfully accepted burden.  Sharkface, you are a valued member of the community and you should remember that.  I want to see you branch out into the world of maintaining the encyclopedia, which is doable without writing but not without working in the mainspace."

Inclusionism on AfDs is OK as long as he's willing to follow community consensus in closing them, and set aside personal opinion; note that DGG (who supported above) is an arch-inclusionist and also one of our best admins. Although I see that some people feel he's too quick to go to DRV and to be harshly critical of admin decisions, I personally think we need ''more'' editors like this, not less; all power needs to be subjected to constant scrutiny, lest it be used arbitrarily.

That in itself (which could merely be called a disagreement of opinion and is frequent and desirable amongst dedicated Wikipedians) is not a reason to oppose. However, he has fairly recently continued to advocate this agenda with such passion and zeal that I cannot be certain enough he would not use admin tools to support it with actions beyond what could reasonably be called consensus on the matter. I'll be fully prepared to support MONGO in an RFA in a few months if either a) the so-called attack sites issue does not resurface and is shown to be passé or uncontroversial, or b) if it does resurface, MONGO either treats it with greater dispassion or stays away from it."

More importantly however, I'm afraid the candidate didn't even understand the question, which is actually far worse than if he merely held a different viewpoint (which might still be sufficient reason not to support). His focus, in contrast to the phrasing of the question, appears not to be on who displayed the objectively ''better'' behaviour (yes, the newbie with the source), but who did something ''wrong''. The consensus-bunch did, but ''not'' in not notifying the newbie about the removal, but in the removal of verifiable content itself (barring other potentially more valid concerns not expressly contained in the scenario, like undue weight etc). The candidate's reply gives the impression that he thinks the newbie in the scenario is ""more right"" than the other editors ''because they were wrong in not notifying the newbie about it''.

A perfect admin has excellent grammar, improves articles, takes no sides, is never terse, is unbiased, and always fair. That's great for a bot. This user is flawed. He has opinions, asserts them, can show bias, and doesn't always bite his tongue. I'm tired of robots. We speak of gaming the system, but being a 1950s American wife incarnate is not my idea of adminship. Having dealt with conflicts, having said shitty things, and getting your hands dirty is the tragic flaw that fails RfAs but gains my support in this case because I support for exactly every reason that is given as an oppose. This user is not the model per se, and we should not aspire to be models, but moreso to be those who are flawed, and carry those flaws over in order to deal with real life situations. Admins should not be held to any higher standard that any other editor, IP or registered. Cops with 4 year degrees are great cops, academically. Those who have been through admin school are great because they have been groomed to follow protocol. This guy's contributions to all areas of Wikipedia have been done with heart,and what's better is that he has made great contributions.

Elonka,Jbmurray,-1,1,2008,"22:22, 11 May 2008","'''Oppose'''.  I think that Jbmurray's university project was a great idea, I enjoyed reading his essay, and I am a big supporter of getting more academics involved with Wikipedia.  However, those reasons aren't enough to support someone for adminship.  One key reason to oppose, is simply that I don't see him needing the tools.  This nom seems to be more of a case of awarding a ""prize"", than giving tools to someone who actively needs them.  Also, and of more concern, when I was recently in a conflict with Jbmurray about the ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'' article, I was not impressed with his on-wiki communication skills. I found him short-tempered, dismissive, and quick to blame, in ways that ''escalated'' a dispute rather than de-escalating it. I also have strong concerns about his involvement with the FA process, because of the growing cliquishness on the part of some of the senior FA reviewers, and the often arbitrary and frequently trivial reasons that are given for opposing the promotion of an article.  I'm not going to go into details about my concerns about the FA reviewing process here, because this isn't the right venue.  However, I do realize that by my opposing Jbmurray's adminship, I may well be diminishing or even destroying any chance that I have of getting another article through the FA political hoops. There's also another issue here, which has to do with [[WP:CIVIL]]. There is a disturbing trend on Wikipedia, that when someone is an article-writer, the culture often overlooks some very serious behavioral problems, specifically as regards civility and personal attacks. This problem is bad enough when dealing with a regular editor, but to have another short-tempered admin, would be a very bad idea.  And to have a group of uncivil admins, who support each other in their attacks on other editors, especially editors who are trying to get articles to FA?  I think that would be an even worse thing for Wikipedia, because that puts too much power into the hands of too few people. In short, I just don't think that Jbmurray handles conflict well, I don't think he would handle the ""power"" of adminship responsibly, I don't think he sets a good example of how a Wikipedian should act, and I don't want to see yet another uncivil admin FA reviewer.  I do have respect for some of the articles that Jbmurray and his students have created.  But I cannot in good conscience support him for administrator at this time. --"

If not, are they aware of gaps in their knowledge, and do they know where to go for information or advice?

For example, in a 12 minute on March 21, he was able to read, assess, investigate 17 different articles---highly prolific or careless?  Prior to that he assessed 22 articles in 17 minutes.  Could it be that he is going after edit counts to meet the criteria within his own guidelines for barnstars?

Martinp,BritandBeyonce,-1,-1,2008,"15:50, 19 January 2008","'''Regretful oppose''' with support to this user's dedication. The oppose is due to the combined effect of two weak factors. First, with all due respect there is a certain simplicity and perhaps even lack of (wiki-)maturity to the answers to the questions. Notwithstanding supporters' assurances that BandB has shown himself able to learn (assurances I have not verified but am willing to believe), image policy is a particularly tricky part of wikipolicy combining a need for legal understanding, policy understanding, and human empathy and hence I feel a need for greater-than-usual assurance of maturity from someone who already intends to be active in this area. Second, while in itself a minor issue, I do think the BritandBeyonce username is a bit unfortunately fancrufty for an admin. I respect BandB's right to use the name and it is not contrary to username policy, but admins for better or worse represent wikipedia and I am worried about the reputational impact of someone with such a name ""laying down the law"" to, for instance, an experienced external expert (or upset BLP victim, or image copyright owner whose image has unfortunately been uploaded with the wrong license information) who is a wikipedia newbie and in need of guidance to avoid disruption."

In the past MFC was opposed for doing too much vandal-fighting, so he's not doing as much of that, and has done a lot of (very good) article-writing. Several people cite immaturity and lack of communication as reasons to oppose; well, I have yet to see any evidence of immaturity, and as for communication, MFC has been good at that from what I've seen. Regarding ""MySpacey tendencies""...I'm trying to work that one out: Nishkid64 mentions above about people coming to MFC for help, hence a lot of user talk edits. That again, doesn't make sense: people go to him for help, and if he responds and helps, he ends up increasing his user talk count, getting opposed for ""socializing too much"", and if he ignores people, he would gets opposed for ""not being communicative enough"".

My experience of Ddstretch is generally in line with what others have said. Without question, he is conscientious, civil, and a major contributor of excellent articles and improvements.  But I'm not sure that would make him a good ''administrator''.  His background is in academia - nothing wrong in that, but it can generate a particular sort of mind set that only the best, the most perfectly justified, the most precisely argued, is good enough.  Anything else is less than the perfection he seeks.  My specific experience followed my making a small edit (informative and interesting, I thought) which he reverted as being not in accordance with guidelines.  Nothing wrong with what he wanted to achieve, but I question how he did it, and how he would deal with similar issues in future.  Rather than showing flexibility and a light touch over what was, in essence, a small disagreement, Ddstretch escalated the issue by raising it on various talk pages and contributing ever lengthier and more precisely argued paragraphs to justify his position.  His view was not ""wrong"" - we all need rules - just mildly inappropriate for the messy and imperfect world in which the great majority of Wikipedia contributors live.  I worry that he would not have the occasionally necessary lightness of touch, or the correct tone, in dealing with well-meaning but less precise or academically qualified editors, and that this would discourage, rather than encourage, many potential contributors whose involvement would benefit Wikipedia.  <s>So, I must reluctantly '''oppose'''.</s>"

The correct way to deal with confusing user names according to [[WP:U|policy]] is to leave a message requesting that the user change his name. After that you should wait, and see if he requests that his name be changed. If he does, then thats great, and if he doesn't, he '''then''' should be blocked. An admin must have the right attitude, and some of this users actions indicate he is ""[[WP|BITE|bitty]]""(which isn't a good trait for an admin or anyone else), thus the attitude of this user probably isn't the best attitude for an admin to have.

I would like to have seen some major edits at one of the other noticeboards or edit abuse forums, as I feel they show an ability to handle issues outsides of one's topical interest/specialty. Additionally, I am concerned that Z-man was not consulted prior to accepting the RfA nom. I know that he is quite busy, and may not have had the time to write a nomination. But I would've expected either an initial support vote or a note on Ctjf83's that he was ready to go up. I'm aware that this may not have been a condition of the coaching relationship, but I feel that admins are expected to know to consult relevant parties in significant situations. If Mr. Z-man can explain this (off-wiki conversation, etc), I am willing to re-consider to Neutral. '''"

I don't know how many admins frequently look at [[CAT:PER]], but it often gets filled up with the non-technical requests that require a good understanding of how to handle edit warriors that are insisting 'zOMG WRONG VERSION!' (I mostly work on the technical and noncontroversial requests there, which were often backlogged at the time when I applied for adminship, but which have since got better, mostly due to the hard work of other administrators.) Requests to change something on a page protected due to edit warring have been known to mount up, and many admins (at least me, and probably many others) wouldn't have the skill or temperament to work on them. (The one time I tried, it lead to a minor controversy.) The risk of an abuse of administrator tools seems low; I have no reason to believe Jouster to be a POV-pusher, and with the bar for desysopping voluntarily set this low, and the self-restriction on the administrator tools to use, I don't think there's much other chance of causing long-term problems.

Dekkappai,Epbr123,-1,1,2008,"19:19, 7 June 2008","'''Reluctant oppose''' Not as strong an oppose as last time, but an oppose nevertheless. I had intended to support Epbr123's second bid for Adminship, but this one comes before I see much improvement in some areas of concern left over from the previous RfA. There were several aspects to Epbr123's disruptions which I think need to be addressed before I would support an RfA. 1) Incivility. He appears to have shown that he can be civil when he wants to, so this concern is addressed. 2) An overly-strict and literalistic interpretation of Wiki Guidelines which all state right up front that they are to be ""treated with common sense and the occasional exception"". This concern remains as strong as ever. Even statements he has made here show that he thinks ""Ignore All Rules""-- a policy, not a guideline-- applies when a guideline is clearly in error. This is an invalid application of ""IAR"" because a guideline which is clearly wrong should be changed and ''never'' followed. Epr123 continues to show hostility towards any interpretation of a guideline for any exceptional case, claiming that instead the ''guideline'' must be changed to accomidate that-- and every-- exception before he will consider it. (I notice AfD hero has changed his opposed based on conversation on this matter with Epbr123. Epbr123's claim that he does not think every exception need be written down, ""to avoid instruction creep"" does not satisfy me. It ''still'' seems a concern with the guidelines-- i.e., keeping them nice and tidy-- not with their common sense interpretation and application.) 3) Epbr123 combined concerns 1 and 2 with a bot-like, mechanical, repetitive editing technique which can be good or bad. This technique, when employed to create valid stubs or to fight vandalism, is good. When it is done to strictly and mechanically enforce guidelines, ignoring all exceptions, and ignoring continued complaint from multiple editors, it is disruptive, leads to time wasted in arguments, and, ultimately, good editors leaving this volunteer project. It needs to be remembered that Wikipedia ''is'' a volunteer project, which depends on its volunteers feeling welcomed and valued. A welcoming atmosphere is destroyed when ""Rules"" are strictly, coldly, and (because not all Admins behave in this manner) inconsistently enforced. Epbr123 and I have had many disagreements in the past, and he has characterized these as ""Inclusionist"" and ""Deletionist"" differences. I disagree with this characterization. Epbr123 has created by now probably tens of thousands of stubs, while I work very slowly, on few articles... I think our differences are in our concern with form and content. Epbr123 is an extreme formalist. The letter of the law must be followed exactly, without regard to real-world interpretations or outcomes. This is a tolerable attitude, perhaps, in an editor, but one that will lead to conflict, disruption and other trouble in the hands of an Administrator."

The question though is, would giving Biruitorui mopship be a responsible thing to do in this context? Well, I've found low comprehension of wikipedia naming conventions and false accusations of incivility [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AIa%C5%9Fi-Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u_Offensive&diff=182883245&oldid=182820286 evidenced here]. The latter comment by Biruitorul nearly two months ago makes it difficult to have the faith that he could be trusted to interpret policy and guidelines objectively, or that he '''would''' be trusted by a significant proportion of the community. His comments there at [[Talk:Iaşi-Chişinău Offensive]] provide strong evidence that patriotism will at least sometimes get the better of him.

I came here expecting to make some absurd '''oh wow I thought you were...''' sort of support, but decided not to.  The points made by the opposes and the neutral are largely compelling to me.  In order of concern I would consider Skomorokh's the most troubling, then Icewedge, then Eco's comments.  I won't go so far as to attach as many adverbs and adjectives as Skomorokh does to that edit, but it is troubling.  Icewedge makes the good (though vague) point that the candidate doesn't resist the 'bandwagon' enough.  If substantiated, that is a troubling accusation.  I'm left with some dim memory (and feeling from the questions) that this is true about the candidate but without some more substantial evidence (e.g. diffs of the candidate reversing support as the mood changes and so forth), I can't oppose based on that.  Eco brought the most concerns to the table but they are least troubling to me.  [[WP:DTTR]], taken in isolation, is not a compelling reason for me to feel that a candidate is not qualified.  It is my opinion that NW is right: lvl 1 templates serve as an easy means to inform people of something and are not just for new users and vandals.  But even setting that opinion aside I can't see how it represents poor judgment.  I object '''strongly''' to the characterization of his AfD closures as 'inept' (a word that Fram never uses).  The word would be ""hasty"" and I see no evidence that NW continued to close AfDs early following that discussion.  Eco's comment about editing other user's posts and then getting touchy about it gets pretty close to the mark.  It does appear that NW bolded that vote (uncool) and then invoked IAR when asked about it (puzzling).  Eco's summary is also worth listening to.  The specific points are not compelling but his 'feel' on NW is valuable.  If this RfA is successful I encourage NW to take that feedback 'onboard' as it were.  But I have confidence in this candidate."

E.g. even the answer to Q8, while ultimately correct, is a bit off. Permanent settlements are generally considered inherently notable, once basic [[WP:V]] requirements are met, and articles about them are, as far as I know, never deleted (speedy or not). While it may be unfair to judge the candiadte on deletion-related questions since he states that he does not intend to be active in closing AfDs early on, I still do not get enough of a feeling of this user having sufficiently solid understanding of WP policies and procedures that I would want to see in an admin (even a new one)."

Remarks like that aren't ostentatious examples of 'biting the newbie', but they add up to make the an uninviting atmosphere for new editors. The newbie in question wrote a fairly long paragraph about why he thought the article shouldn't have been deleted, and was given a one-line response that was completely unhelpful and confusing. It wouldn't have been so very hard to give a few links, and explain why it was deleted. Dealing with newbies is hassle, fair enough, but if you can't be bothered to explain yourself when they get confused by our sometimes-arcane policies, then you probably shouldn't be working in an area that is so closely related to the edits of new editors. I think you should get more involved in collaborative stuff and spend a bit less time fighting vandals.

I have seen IMatthew around and while I believe wholeheartedly that he is a very well intended, good faith user, there's something about the comments I've seen from him that makes me very uneasy and I'm just not comfortable with giving him admin rights. The admin coaching page is quite troubling to me as it displays a surprising amount of lack of clue and while I don't really care about the Q5 above, I think the fact he gave an answer which wasn't what he really thought reflects a lack of maturity and a desire to blow with the wind of popular opinion. I am rather concerned how this might affect his decisions as an administrator, that he might do or say things according to what he thinks others want him to say or do, rather than what he really believes is right. I'm very glad to see he has contributed some excellent content in the form of FA and GAs, but I'm not impressed with the ""My Spacey"" aspects - his shops and his focus on user and user talk page (about half his total edit count is to user/user talk and he has double the number of user/user talk edits than mainspace contributions and I think this is unbalanced for a non-administrator).

An example of talking about contributors rather than contributions is also found [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:United_Kingdom&diff=prev&oldid=194424208 here] - again, no purpose of moving discussion along, but mocking other users who may hold an alterative view or look at a problem from a different angle to his own. Amongst other pages, I'm concerned about how Deacon went about putting his views forwards [[Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_%28settlements%29#Scotland_guidelines|here]]. I made an edit in good faith but Deacon seems to imply I did not. He did not contact me for an explanation or my views, and again acts more as a ""joker"", mocking others' views rather than behaving like a mediator. In this capacity, I wouldn't feel comfortable with Deacon having administrator status. I do not think his mediation skills are developed enough and his manner, dare I say civility, with those with alternative perspectives leaves much to be desired. <span style=""color:#696969;font-size:larger;font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"">-- '''"

It's only through these means that we can retain new editors who are just a little unsure of how things work around here.  I think Gazimoff, in addition to the various other qualities expressed by more prominent individuals above, has demonstrated this ability in his various interactions around the project, having been described as helpful by newer editors, and in more heated disputes such as the recent one at AN/I.

The Caveman Williams thing is a judgement call, IMHO -- I can see both views. More than half of the rest ''were'' speedily deleted after Redfarmer's request, and then recreated. I can hardly hold that against him, unless we expect him to watchlist every article he requests a speedy on. (I do that personally, but I'm weird that way.) I also checked out the communication concern brought up by another opposer. There were a few cases where Redfarmer let another editor answer the question (but the questions '''were''' answered) on the questioner's talk page. But when Redfarmer did answer the question, the answer was well thought out, relatively complete, and helpful. All in all, I think Redfarmer will be a net plus having the mop.--"

Adminship, when used, is serious to a degree, but not using it all the time like some other users might want, isn't serious either. I'd rather have an admin who doesn't use the tools at all, than one who uses them inappropriately. This user seems like the kind to use them appropriately, and sparingly which I think is perfect. some admins get upset in RfA's when the candidate declares they won't help in a specific area, or when they get the impression that they'll help in an area they think doesn't need much help. just cause they won't help in YOUR area, doesn't mean they won't be helpful.

I'm a bit concerned at the exponential leap in RfA standards - it sometimes seems an editor needs a perfect record of creating multiple FA-class articles with nary a typo, adding penetrating insights to every policy page, preserving the grace and gentility of a saint at all times, and maintaining a 100% edit summary record even in the sandbox. On the specific issues - the article on [[Counterpoint LLC]] is a one-line stub that doesn't assert notability, but that surely isn't a heinous crime. Out of 17,000 contributions, a single minor mistake in creating an inoffensive non-notable stub is nothing. Edit summaries? Yes, do something about that, like turn on the automated prompt. The answer to question 5? Too aggressive, and not the right approach, but is offset by the rest of your record."

I have never seen NW angry. While I've seen him moderately annoyed, he somehow manages to pass off his annoyance with jokes and a smile, an ability I would very much like to gain from him. As for his actual contributions, he does, or has done, a bit of everything. I've seen him helpdesk'ing, in discussions, doing content creation, and battling vandals. This isn't even a net positive case, I'm sure that NW will be a superb admin. <small>''Note: I am a good friend of this user''.</small> (I just editconflicted twice >_<) <font color=""777777"">"

If it were, say, in the fair use area, I wouldn't oppose for that, but the deletion area is too important to be omitted and is inevitable for an admin. This is particularly worrying when he says that he'd like to clear up C:CSD and backlogs in his answer to Q1. This said, I think that he's a very good vandal fighter and makes a great job with Huggle, but it's not enough to determine if he'll do well with the tools.

Pascal.Tesson,BirgitteSB,1,1,2008,"01:33, 28 March 2008","'''Support''' I'm puzzled by all the hoopla surrounding her answer to Q1, especially coming from administrators. Sure, admins clear backlogs and while there are a few workhorses out there, the fact is many admin accounts do relatively little as far as closing XfDs, speedy deleting stuff, working at AIV. Yet, even when we are ''not'' working specifically on admin backlogs, we still routinely use the tools simply to be better editors. Access to deleted revisions can be extremely informative when trying to understand an editorial conflict. Access to deleted contributions often allows one to realize that editor X with 3 harmless junk edits has in fact created 10 hoax articles and needs to be blocked. There's this myth going around that being an admin is a mysterious super-complex endeavour which requires years of studying policy and understanding its finer points. It's not, especially if you're a responsible person unlikely to start using these tools in areas you're not familiar with. From what I can see, BigitteSB has shown a sense of responsibility and has shown dedication to wiki-projects. The net-effect of her adminship can only be positive."

Ferrylodge,SheffieldSteel,-1,1,2008,"04:26, 13 August 2008","'''Oppose''' I have crossed out my ""neutral"" comment below, and regretfully am moving to oppose.  Until I noticed this RfA, I had not encountered or observed SheffieldSteel's editing in a very long time.  And I still have not tried to comprehensively study this nominee's editing.  However, in view of the comment that I crossed out below, I have now taken a very brief look at a few of SheffieldSteel's recent edits.  In particular, I'm concerned about recent edits at [[Abortion debate]] (I have never been involved with that article as far as I recall, but have been involved with related articles, as indicated unfortunately in my block log).  Anyway, on 7 August 2008, SheffieldSteel made [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abortion_debate&diff=230403397&oldid=230382909 this edit] followed by [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAbortion_debate&diff=230419100&oldid=230413194 this talk page comment].  If people are interested, they can take a look.  The idea that an article on that subject should exclude relevant comments by a leading political figure is troublesome enough, but referring to that figure as ""Ronald Reagan, of all people"" confirms my concern that this nominee has a tendency to needlessly make certain contentious articles more contentious."

Spending time in the areas admins edit to, can greatly improve your knowledge of the role. I'm seeing this lack of knowledge in your answers to the questions (specifically: 1. '''Q1'''- you never mentioned what areas you intended to help out with, just a continuation of what you normally do; which does not require tools. 2. '''Q4''' - you should at least be aware of the controversy surrounding this. 3. '''Q5''' - you didn't want to look it up, but its good to have a round about knowledge of the policies we did create since we didn't create them for window-dressing alone. And a ban is not permanent; it takes the community to implement, and the community to reverse. Also they can always request an unblock. 4. '''9b''' - I would hate to see pages being protected solely for ''quick changes'', even if the subject of a BLP just died. 5. '''Q9d''' - I suggest rereading [[WP:IAR]] and its corollaries. 6. '''Q10''' - I would have liked to see you mention an [[WP:XFD|XfD]] here. This is where consensus is derived on a daily basis and [[WP:CCC|changes]] just as fast. 7. '''Q11''' - Protection should come last. In this example, '''users''' are discussed. If there is a 3rr, the user gets blocked leaving no reason for protection. And if the second user is about to reach 3rr, they usually get a warning  ). You'd know most of this if you were active in these areas (such as [[WP:RFPP|RFPP]], [[WP:AIV|AIV]], [[WP:AN3|3rr]]). What strikes me the most is, where is the need for the tools? You seem to enjoy what you are doing, and I am happy to see that you would continue to do this even if you had these tools.

After looking through Philosopher's contributions, I feel that he does exhibit the overall tendencies and character traits that are important in my opinion. Investigating his inter-editor interactions, I do not see anything that would require me to withhold a support. He has sufficient edits to the mainspace to indicate an understanding of wiki policies and guidelines. As for the Question 4 issue, that is a difficult situation which is better handled through the OTRS system. I applaud Philosopher for attempting to answer that question here in the context of an RfA, but I would counsel him, should such a situation actually occur, to use [[WP:ANI]], or in matters such as this where there may be privacy and legal issues involved, to submit the issue to Cary or the OTRS list.

Mazca,Mr. IP,0,-1,2008,"08:47, 3 August 2008","'''Neutral'''.`Let me ramble a little: Firstly, I think your answer to xeno's Q4 is truly excellent, one of the best answers I've seen to that question. I also genuinely laughed out loud at your pre-emptive Kurt answer`- in fact many of your question answers are very good indeed. Unfortunately, the blatant 'experimental' nature of your RfA, combined with a difficult-to-impossible task of actually finding the majority of your contributions, makes me far too wary to support this. For the first point, we've had two fairly-recent 'is adminship really a big deal?' RfAs, and neither of them succeeded - [[WP:Requests for adminship/Ali'i|Ali'i]] stimulated some good discussion and a lot of support, but ultimately failed with a lot of well-argued opposition too, while [[WP:Requests for adminship/RMHED 2|RMHED]] did worse, owing mainly to it being just as experimental and rather less polite. So, in my view, conducting this experiment to see if RfA is a big deal is akin to running an experiment to test whether air is breathable - it clearly is, as has already been demonstrated. In fact, while ''adminship itself'' probably still isn't that big a deal, ''the RfA process'' very clearly is, and that should be clear just from looking at a few recent RfAs. Hence, I don't really think you expect this RfA to succeed, given that I've seen you at RfA a lot recently and I hope you've noted the same as me about the general criteria. As a result, this pretty much falls into the category of 'disrupting Wikipedia to make a point', or just 'making drama', and I don't really want to support either of those things. My other concern, the sparsity of your contributions that we can actually review, is another point I know you're keen to demonstrate - that allowing IPs to contribute freely is important. Unfortunately, the biggest problem with IPs is that they are generally dynamic, and so while I fully agree that IP editing is important to Wikipedia, for specific exercises in community trust like an RfA it's just insufficient - because we can't get a handle on how you behave overall in the long term. In summary: (1) Nice question answers, I suspect you're entirely well intentioned (2) but I can't really tell that for sure, and I don't like the method you used, and (3) Wall Of Text hits you for 2521 damage. You have died. ~ <font color=""#228b22"">"

Edit summary usage is also quite weak.  The only real WP space work is in a handful of AfDs.  But my biggest concern is the extremely low count of Talk and User Talk edits (500 and 100 compared to 7000 mainspace edits).  To me, this indicates that the user may not be communicative enough to be an effective administrator.

I'm also quite worried about the answers to the optional questions; most of the comments and ""what i'd do as an admin"" seems to be CSD/AFD based; a bit narrow. Admins should diversify, not focus too much on a particular section. AFD reasoning also seems a bit weak; not something you really want from someone who, if made an admin, would be closing the discussion as well as commenting. From question seven your knowledge of blocking policy also seems a bit iffy, so i'm afraid i'll have to go for oppose. Sorry if i sound too damning; you've made some excellent contributions. My advice would be to read through the comments here and institute any suggested changes, similar to what you did with your first nomination. Then give it some time before you apply again. It's probably best to wait till you're nominated by someone else (that's what i'm planning to do) since if there is another editor who has an NPOV view of my contributions and finds them worthy enough for me to be admin-material, it's less likely to be shot down in flames.

I refer to what I felt was a hostile, insulting and uncommunicative response ''to my neutral'' at [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Gazimoff#Neutral|Gazimoff's RFA]].  Maybe this is his only such bout, and if so it wouldn't be fair to oppose for the time lightning struck and I happened to be involved.  Gazimoff's RFA was clearly passing and I just wanted to note a concern.  I think his behavior in that encounter directly contradicts his answer to Q3.  He claims he tries to be understanding, yet when I attempted to talk to him, he was rude, explicitly uninterested in understanding what I was saying.  He was even bothered by the idea that I'd try to explain my opinion on an RFA at that RFA.  That's just about the opposite of an editor interested in understanding. --"

The Featured List and DYK brag sheet weakens a bit under scrutiny - I'm very interested in the answer to Sandstein's question above. MFC does good work vandal-fighting, and I even think the tools might help him do that job more effectively. If there was some way to guarantee that he would ''only'' use the tools to block vandals and handle DYK's, that might fly. But we can't un-bundle the tools, and I'm not at all confident in his ability to fulfill other administrative roles based on the presentation here.<p>I don't really need to see more evidence of vandal fighting, or even more DYK's or featured lists. I'd like to see some concrete, positive evidence of good judgement - a conflict where this editor has behaved maturely, or a thorny situation they've untangled, or even a case where they've cogently disagreed with an admin's actions. I can't subscribe to the idea that adminship is no big deal anymore when it's obviously untrue. We have enough vandal-fighters and RFPP patrollers. We need more admins with demonstrated good judgement, maturity, and a willingness and skill at resolving conflicts. MFC may very well have that skill set, but it's just not coming through here.<p>You're a good editor. You do good work. Adminship isn't a trophy or a validation, and if this doesn't pass you shouldn't take it as a rejection. Adminship is just a particular niche; someone could be a great editor, vandal-fighter, and encyclopedist, and not be right for this particular niche.<p>Incidentally, MFC, this RfA came to my attention through the behavior of your nominator.

In general, I respect the claims made by opposers below that the candidate might not have enough experience for us to judge his use of the tools.  I don't agree with the arguments surrounding AIV counting (really, no offense to RCP or vandal blockers, but AIV is not the hardest part of having the tools)--I think that dealing with obvious vandalism is a slightly mechanical task that a candidate with some discretion can accomplish without error.  I do not expect this candidate to use the block button in a case of reported vandalism without first checking to see if it was really vandalism and ensuring that some warnings were given.  We have bright-lines at AIV and 3RR to make this very easy but even in the case of determining borderline cases I trust this candidate to make the right choice.  In re: the sandbox issue.  Just because it isn't a reader facing space doesn't make typing ""fuck you"" in the sandbox an ok action.  I'm not interested in jumping into the somewhat beardy discussion of whether or not an invective without a target is a personal attack.  That's academic.  It is right to revert it and it is right to warn the user about inserting content and contextless profanity into a space designed for new editors.  I'm also not convinced by the ""you don't need the tools"" arguments.  Not every candidate will be like[[Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/JPG-GR|JPG-GR]], where they have already undertaken a job that would be made considerably easier with the tools.  Most administrators are just article writers who happen to protect pages or block users.  This candidate wants to be just that.  We really come back to the basic question of ""do we trust this candidate to make the right decisions and ask the right questions"".  I haven't worked with this candidate personally so I can't judge from direct experience.  I can, however, make a guess from looking at the answers to questions and a few of his contributions.  I think we can trust this candidate.  That is what matters (to me).  So I'll support."

Legitimate concerns were raised by numerous editors, clearly good faith efforts to clarify what was and was not acceptable behavior, and in no way casting doubt on Epbr's character; yet Epbr's first comment was to ""demand an apology"" from one of the editors, unnecessarily raising the tenor of the discussion, and utterly ignoring all other comments. I will say that I've had pleasant interactions with Epbr on [[WP:GA]], but the items listed above betray what I consider a pretty significant lack of collegiality.

Still, that doesn't really say anything about how someone will use his or her admin tools. Being able to deal sensibly with difficult users (such as pov pushers) is an important quality for an admin to have. Such problems often require tough decisions and I think most editors feel a bit awkward when approaching that kind of problem? Unfortunately I agree that Coppertwig have shown incredibly poor judgment in this area so far (as shown above). And from what little I have come in contact with Coppertwig before haven't inspired confidence in this regard. I'm also a bit concerned about support for some dubious RfArb's (and as far as I know there was no discussion with the subject before jumping on the RfArb).

That and the other username example above makes me urge Rudget to be very careful while blocking. No one would want to go through all the hassle of creating new accounts or requesting unblocks just to do a bit of unpaid work. Even mistaken warnings [[User talk:Vardos|could probably drive away]] some valuable editors. Worry about content or potential loss of contributions first. Username concerns, especially the one like the 15g's do not disrupt wikipedia and such issues can be solved by a civilized discussion ''before'' blocking.

Not every admin is as involved as some (I know there are admins who block more people in a week than I have since i became an admin.)  Do I trust her?  Yes... I say that having reviewed her edits/talk page and based upon the quality of people who nominated her.  Does she meet my criteria for admin?  Not really.  I personally like to see more edits and article building, but I also like to see people promoted who fill unusual niches.  Birgitte fills a niche that most of us don't bother with and don't care about.  She is very active in finding sources for unsourced articles.  She is also active in discussions on many different subjects---including but not limited to a very contentious debate concerning OR.  Will she be our garden variety admin?  No, but I think having an admin who frequents unusual spots (the places most of us don't go) can be beneficial.  Also finding sources for the unsual is article building, just via a different venue"

I don't mind too much that he was previously desysopped; what I do mind is the overly simplistic attitude of, ""well, I've changed.  Isn't that enough?""  According to [[User:Geni|Geni's userpage]], he made 10,000 edits by 2006, plus he's been around since 2004—why wasn't he changing ''then''?  There are some successful RfAs here where the candidate, although not new, isn't remarkably senior and doesn't have tens of thousands of edits—then I could understand some lapses in judgement or some hasty overreaction that resulted in a desysop when Jimbo steps in.  But something just says to me that he should have known better by then, or at least could be more specific in the answers to the questions instead of sidestepping them.  [[User:Iridescent|Iridescent]] stated that it would seem unfair to penalise someone for their honesty in not creating a fresh account.  I certainly agree with that, in cases where a brand new user (especially if it's a teen male!) makes a couple of vandalising edits, sees the error of his ways, but keeps the account, with the corresponding ""shame"", even though it would be easy to move to a new one.  But regarding Geni keeping his account, which had, at the time, 3+ years of history and invested time and contributions, honesty probably had nothing to do with it!

Therefore, if a discussion was occurring on-wiki and subsequently deleted because of BLP, that's an indicator to switch the discussion to private places, such as IRC or email.  Furthermore, these discussions (on-wiki) also must be oversighted due to the sensitivity.  Besides all that, I have a feeling that this user is strongly prone to jumping the gun when he does not understand a specific situation; one example would be [[Wikipedia:WikiProject U.S. Roads/Newsletter/Newsroom#Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Highways 2|volunteering to write a newsletter story about an arbitration case]] when understanding is minimal.

FMF, though, seems, consistent with the analyses of (to name three) Regent, Moonriddengirl, and MrPrada, possessed of a sound sense of judgment, a deliberative temperament, a keen intellect, conversance with policy (and of the nature of the areas whereof the policy governing which he might not be acquainted), and a collegial, collaborative personality, which conclusion is, on the whole, bolstered by the history of his involvement with certain BLP issues, including those surrounding [[Celebrity sex tape]], discussed infra, which involvement demonstrates an ability to apply policy consistent with the community's understanding of policy, if not optimally to communicate relative to that understanding (it should probably be noted, too, that the inclusion of the ""Rumors"" section about the propriety of which there appears to exist some dispute seems to have commanded a consensus of involved editors before protection&mdash;whether that has since changed, I haven't undertaken to see, but ''post facto'' changes in the views of the community wouldn't seem particularly useful to one seeking to adjudge FMF's actions&mdash;and that Sceptre's construction of BLP, one that he would, I'm sure, admit is much more strict than that embraced by the community, was rejected by many editors, if not always in the unfortunately curt manner adopted once or twice by FMF, blunting, certainly, submissions that the substance of FMF's behavior bears out a misunderstanding of policy and practice or is somehow wrong; in any event, we have enough admins who err, to the multi-faceted detriment of the project, in applying BLP absolutely, and it is heartening to find a candidate who appreciates nuance in the same way the community writ large do), such that I am able to conclude with a good deal of confidence that [[User:Jahiegel/Views on Wikipedia/Requests for adminship|the net effect on the project of the candidate's being sysop(p)ed should be positive]]."

Walton One,Keilana,1,1,2008,"13:10, 6 January 2008","'''Weak Support'''. Per Dorftrottel, I applaud her decision to run for reconfirmation. However, I looked through her recent admin logs, and although the vast majority of her admin actions were fine, I found a couple that I wasn't happy with. [[Special:Undelete/Amelia_Bingham|This page]] should not have been speedied (a better version has now been recreated, but the original (viewable by admins only) asserted notability and was not a legitimate CSD A7). Likewise, I wasn't impressed with her deletion here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=James_Barker_(athlete)]. Her deletion reason read ''This is ridiculous. Why should some guy that gets in the Olympics and then gets immediately eliminated deserve an article? No way he's going to be covered in reliable, 3rd party sources; he won't satisfy WP:BIO. Chalk it up to WP:IAR.'' This is clearly an unacceptable use of administrative tools; such comments are fine on AfDs, but not to justify a unilateral admin judgment. (To her credit, however, she subsequently restored the page and took it to AfD when requested to do so.) I almost went neutral as a result of this; however, the question here is not whether Keilana's judgment is perfect, but whether she has done anything bad enough to merit desysopping. Considering that I only found two bad judgment calls out of several hundred, and both were reversible (and reversed), I don't think that she deserves an oppose; she certainly shouldn't be penalised for choosing to submit to the community's judgment when she could easily have not done so. I am very glad that she ran for reconfirmation and submitted to the judgment of the community, and that I have therefore had the opportunity to raise these concerns about her past actions; I hope that she will bear those concerns in mind in her future work as an admin."

I got the sense of someone who means well, but is a bit too short-tempered at times, and who is more inclined to support a personal sense of what an article should be like, rather than what Wikipedia guidelines and policies require.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pauline_Fowler&diff=prev&oldid=187354855] This is especially a concern considering the controversies over how much ""in-universe"" information should be in soap opera articles, an area where Trampikey participates almost exclusively.  I think that Trampikey is also unaware of just how stressful that adminship can be, and I don't think Trampikey would yet be well-suited to dealing with vandals. It's one thing to revert and block vandals, and it's another to deal with the fallout when the vandals come back and attack you and question your decisions.

You also have very few discussions with other users, with the only WT-space edit being a [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Protection_policy&diff=prev&oldid=172446822 revert]. <s>Most mainspace contributions are in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?limit=50&title=Special%3AContributions&contribs=user&target=Zedla&namespace=0&year=&month=-1 form of revisions] with no reasonable evidence that you've yet developed an article or used it as a basis for discussion.</s> There is also a little confusion over this user's understanding of the SSP case board ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Undelete/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/76.102.193.102], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Cyclopticbob], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Mschuhe3]), and [[WP:UAA|UAA]] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Usernames_for_administrator_attention&diff=prev&oldid=189156709]), with few edits elsewhere in the Wikipedia namespace. This combined with the relatively infrequent and discontinued discussions with others users, make me unhappy with this user becoming an administrator at this time."

At the risk of channelling [[Harry Frankfurt]], I suspect the opposers don't even know what they mean by ""too much drama,"" except they think that it is bad, and by extension Avruch is bad. The veracity of the statement can't be established; I suppose we can stand [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith]] on its head and presume the sincerity of the user, but the lack of specificity and falsifiability precludes any possibility of engagement on the question.

Having respect for those with whom you disagree is an important thing and with that user box on your page, it calls into question your ability to deal fairly with users who believe differently than you do.  Also, you are marking substantially all of your edits as minor, even ones which are clearly major.  Only reverts of simple vandalism or insignificant spelling/formatting/etc fixes should be marked as minor.  I am also concerned about [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Puente&oldid=225062140 this speedy request].  Presumably, anything you would tag for a speedy as a non-admin you would delete as an admin and unilaterally deleting that article would obviously be a really bad idea.  You had two minutes between your previous edit and that one.  If this article had been something you found in new pages patrol that said ""DAVId PUENTE IS MY BESTEST FRIEND EVER"" ok, that takes 2 seconds.  But it had been around for two years and had multiple (supposed) sources.  Two minutes is not enough time to review the sources, review the history (to see if a better version existed previously) and make a determination to delete it.

I think we've all ignored the occasional ""y did u deleet mah paige??/"" message, but I think it is unacceptable to ignore a legitimate question asked by an established user. As an admin, this is something you have to deal with very often, and you can't just not answer people. Furthermore, as great as he is with code, we're writing an encyclopedia here, and to my knowledge Cobi has no article writing experience to speak of. I appreciate that Cobi is not a writer, and don't expect multiple GAs and FAs from him.

Of course we all make mistakes and anyone can have a bad day, but someone with a history of being exhibiting incivility when involved in difficult discussions is someone who may be more prone to abuse the tools. Time and learning from one's mistakes heals many things; perhaps a significant stretch of time demonstrating the patience, self-control, and heightened levels of civility required by sysops will change many of these concerns, but now I too must reluctantly oppose. --"

For instance, giving somebody a ""warning"" because they ""violated [[WP:NPA]] and [[WP:CIVIL]]"" shows a knowledge of policy, but leaving a personal note saying that he seems to be creating more heat than light shows an understanding of policy.

I've read through a good bit of your latest contributions, as well as [[User:L'Aquatique/RFA FAQ]], and you've got the right idea. I like your work at MedCab and with your various WikiProjects; this shows me that you clearly realize that peaceful and civil collaboration is absolutely number one for this project. I don't entirely agree with all of your answers on your RFA FAQ page, though. In the ""If you see two or three different IPs repeatedly vandalizing the same article"" question, keep in mind that blocking is preventative, not punitive. You could likely solve the problem by merely blocking the two or three IPs for a short period of time, even just a few hours. That way, you wouldn't have to protect the article at all, leaving it open for potentially constructive contributions. You should also have a bit of a think more on the role of admins on the project. While we do need to be police/mediators sometimes, we should by and large not think of ourselves as somehow above other members; we need to work really hard on dispelling this air of grandeur that admins think they have. These are just some hopefully helpful suggestions from me that you might think over. As I said, you very clearly have the right idea with what Wikipedia is trying to do as a whole, you do fantastic work here, and you demonstrate a clear need for the extra buttons. I wish you the very best of luck, and please feel free to ask me if you ever have any questions. Here is my trust."

With ""a lot of her user talk edits are templates"", that's only because, in addition to her article-writing, she has done a lot of vandal-fighting, and the fact that she's warning vandals after she's reverted them is a good thing and should not be held against her.

I can't find any created or majorly edited pages in the last 1000 edits (again, it's mainly anti-vandalism work).

JavierMC,Protonk,-1,1,2008,"23:15, 16 October 2008","'''Oppose''' I have not had much interaction with him but the one that I did have did not leave me with a warm feeling.  We became involved in a discussion at AN/I ([[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive482#User:Jarajet89|see this section of AN/I archive titled '''''User:Jarajet89''''', for context]]) where we had a difference of opinion of whether a disruptive editor who refused to respond to any attempts at communication, should or should not be blocked for a short period, to force some kind of reply to repeated inquires as to why they were continually removing an image from an article.  Every attempt at communication with Jarajet89 failed to get any kind of response.  The discussion at AN/I became a discussion of Protonk's and my view on blocking to force communication and end disruption.  The editor continued to refuse communication, even when Protonk tried to ascertain why he was editing in the manner that he was, which eventually resulted in Protonk filing a 3RR and the editor being blocked for 48hrs.  Protonk posted this action in the AN/I discussion, to which I replied ""no comment"".  His immediate reaction was to rip into me for what he felt was a he was wrong and I was right plug.  I replied to his reaction with a further explanation of what I meant by my comment, but the AGF of my comment, considering it was right under the 3RR notice he had posted, being made on the 3RR rapid response, seemed to not have entered his mind.  I would invite any editor to view my edit history and my participation at AN/I, and would expect that before someone ripped into me, they would at least give me some credit for not being a drama seeker or immature as to want too disparage them.  This incident being little over a week ago, does not give me the impression he is ready at this time to deal with the duties an administrator faces in levelheaded and cooperative discourse. This is the impression I am left with at this time, but do not see it as something that can not be changed with less contentious interation with him.--<small><span style=""border:1px solid black;padding:1px;"">"

Someone stated above that a person can 'change' overnight. True, to an extent, but they certainly cannot proove that they have changed in an equally short space of time, though having said that HSR does show positive signs. ''However'', regardless of comments in the discussion above, I get the feeling that the essays were indeed just deleted to hide those views, rather than the views changing. I opposed his last RfA on the basis of his views, and so my view hasn't changed now.

Pedro,Mr. IP,-1,-1,2008,"19:49, 3 August 2008","''Time was, anyone with a demonstrated commitment to the project and some knowledge of policy could make it through.'' The issue here is that this experiment's aim (as determined by the content and context of that statement) are flawed. The ideals of RFA (to grant +sysop to dedicated reasonably knowledgable editors) have not changed one whit. The criteria and standards to prove commitment and knowledge have however. This is a result of wider circumstances, not least of which is that Wikipedia is now the 8th most popular site on the net. The vast damage that can be caused by poor deletions and bad blocks are no longer small things. And the technical ability to replace the main page with the image of an erect penis now has far greater reach then a few years ago. Whilst I don't disagree RFA has huge failings I am also of the opinion and understanding that our best output in all areas (main space, projects space, software implementation etc.) comes from discussed changes. Yes, [[WP:BOLD]] is good. But [[WP:RECKLESS]] is not a guideline or policy. I respect the debate this RFA has created, and I understand the intentions of MR. IP and would be pleased to support him in changes to the community's approach to adminship. But not in this fashion. Therefore let us disregard the ""experiment"" aspect of this RFA, in which case it boils down to the basic RFA criteria of ''""Do I trust you to use the buttons correctly?""''. On the evidence of contributions, not yet. Certainly not ""never"" but not yet. I'd also request that he perhaps now discontinue the experiment as I can see no further value that will be gained from it. <small><span style=""border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;"">"

We don't really know who/what people are unless they self-declare and even then you have to take what people say with a grain of salt and I think young people who have aspirations of becoming administrators will just stop self-declaring their age if their age is going to be used against them as an RfA standard. Trust me, a 12-year-old is not going to wait until they turn 18 to become an administrator, they just won't tell you how old they are. So I find age-based opposes rather misguided and self-defeating because ultimately young people will not self-identify and you won't know they're 12-years-old when they come to RfA. I personally prefer to look at maturity when reviewing any candidate rather than going by what they say is their age. However, I have to oppose this RfA because I agree with what Iridescent said at oppose comment 1. Looking through your edits, it is very difficult to get a handle on your understanding of policy because you have so few non-automated edits and your XfD edits don't give me a great insight into your ability to apply deletion policy. Please consider making more non-automated edits and participating more in discussions so that other users can get an idea of your understanding of our policies and how you would apply policy if you were an admin."

What there are are heavily focussed on a few particular articles.  I suspect this is an attempt to gain featured article or list status for personal plaudits. This fits in with the appearance of being desperate to gain adminship - is this just another trophy for your Wikipedia account?  Much has been said about the previous 'come back in x months' experiences, but I think this should be 'go away and ''forget about it'' for now'.  If at some point in the future a pattern of substantive edits in established and adminship seems a natural progression for MFC then by all means go for it again, but establishing some kind of history solely in an attempt to gain adminship seems a bad idea from the start."
Neil916,Cbl62,0,1,2008,"07:37, 17 September 2008","'''Neutral''' I was leaning towards opposing the candidate for a couple of issues, primarily temperment and concerns of how the block button would be used.  I posted question number 4 in reference to a fairly recent incident that suggests to me that the candidate would be inclined to issue punitive blocks, but Cbl62 responded very quickly to the question and I'm less concerned about that now.  Of additional concern was a warning on an anonymous editor [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:71.175.162.227&diff=prev&oldid=224461760 here] that in my opinion was excessively harsh in reaction to petty schoolkid vandalism that is all too common here.  I was very unhappy with Cbl62's interactions with {{user|Phlegm Rooster}} regarding a copyvio tag on the [[University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor]] article ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Phlegm_Rooster&oldid=227420274 discussion]), and in another incident, a conversation with {{user|AdultSwim}} [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:AdultSwim&oldid=222765727#San_Fernando_Building here] (note that the text in bold was put in boldface by AdultSwim, not Cbl62) left a bad taste in my mouth, but after reflecting further, I think that it was the comment about not having any constructive suggestions in the last edit that bothered me, and when taken in the context of being in response to someone who threw out comments like ''""Please Raise any issues at you may have at Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts. You can lord your accomplishments there too""'' wasn't likely to cause AdultSwim to cry himself to sleep that night.   I'd like to suggest a better use of edit summaries, but for me that in itself is not a reason to oppose.  Overall, I'm concerned about how Cbl62 might react with the admin tools when faced with gross incivility, so I'll raise my concerns, but stop short of opposing this request and instead simply express my hope that my concern is unfounded."

I find your lack of patience in these cases completely understandable (and part of why I could never go for adminship) but if you ''do'' wish to become an administrator you're going to have to work on those. Sorry, other than that you're a pretty alright all-round editor, though increased participation in certain areas (and at the very least a familiary with them) as noted by Realist would also work to your advantage. Good luck! +"
AndonicO,WBOSITG,1,1,2008,"20:09, 7 May 2008","I oppose the admin coaching, per Kurt. Also, your answer to question 5 is somewhat off the mark (minor though): ""''Firstly, I would semi-protect the article for a period of two week, to prevent any short-term vandalism.''"" The question mentioned ""two or three"" vandals; revert, warn, and block if necessary, no protection needed. ""''Secondly, I would warn and/or block the IPs for a suitable period of time (perhaps a week).''"" On the mark... nearly. Block for a week only if they've been blocked at least once (I myself prefer a 72 hour block as #2, though, and a week-long one for third block). Also, per Anthony right above. ·"

I think it may be justified in some cases where a candidate's record is particularly outstanding. That does not appear to be the case here. In fact, there are sufficient reasons to worry about both the grasp of policy and general maturity issues. Initial answers to RfA questions were too short, luckluster and sometimes plain wrong. As noted by Seresin, the answer to Q5 was incorrect: you should not decline a block for an unblock you had given and leave it to another admin to make a decision on an unblock request. The answer to Q7 regarding BLP was also problematic. As noted by others, the article-writing record is somewhat underwhelming. The WP:AN discussion link provided by East718 is particularly concerning. It involves a discussion regarding fairly controversial, complicated and dicey matters of some WP article images on Wikipedia being classified in the UK as child pornography and the legal implications thereof for WMF (I think Gurch has just gotten a 3RR block in relation to the controversy arising from that WP:AN thread). In my opinion this exactly the sort of an issue where an involvement by a user (and even more so an admin) who is a minor would be particularly inappropriate and the aggressive and immature comments by the candidate in WP:AN thread were quite worriesome."

Second, concern is being raised over the isolated comments made by the candidate that, admittedly, were not framed correctly. This should not be a cause for disqualification. People will, on occasion, say the wrong thing. But that is why the words “sorry” and “apologize” are part of the vocabulary. On a few too many RfA occasions, I’ve seen highly qualified candidates whacked because isolated incidents of poorly-considered opinions and badly-phrased comments were taken out of context and magnified inappropriately in an effort to obscure a larger body of positive work.

I'll repeat here what I said there: ""Balloonman is doing something here that I and others have asked for as a way to improve the RfA process.  If some of the guys who have a LOT of experience at RfA can say ""Ahem, you might want to look at similar RfAs, they didn't do very well, would you consider withdrawing?"", then a lot of good things happen: it saves the time of reviewers, it makes RfAs less contentious, it gives the candidate some other similar RfAs to study so they can figure out what they might need to be able to pass, and it may shorten the time that they should wait before coming back.  Of course, this only works if the ""old"" guys are perceived as doing this in the best interest of the candidate.  My feeling FWIW is that Balloonman has your interests at heart here, Nja, and I agree with him, but I hope you don't feel badgered.  I have categories for admins in my own head (maybe shared by no one else), and you'd be what I think of as a ""content admin""; I'd want a content admin to know the content policies and content-related guidelines.  I think a problem here is that there isn't any community-wide process that gives people a ""thumbs-up"" other than the RfA process, which is a shame; if you were running for ""certified Good-Article reviewer"" or something, the criteria would be different.

[[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/FuelWagon v. Ed Poor]] for example is where Ed was desyssopped, after having already been decratted. I might be able to support after that, especially since that was over 2 years ago. However,  after that, Ed continued to engage in serious POV-pushing, resulting in another arbitration case, brought by me- [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Ed Poor 2]]. The ArbCom in that decision found that Ed had 1) engaged in deliberately disruptive behavior to [[WP:POINT|make a point]], 2) created myriad POV forks on multiple topics and 3) repeatedly made edits against consensus as well as repeatedly editing technical subjects of which he by his own admission had no basic understanding. This ArbCom decision occurred after a heavily attended RfC which did not alter Ed's behavior at all. The ArbCom in that decision put Ed on a general probation to which any uninvolved admin could prohibit Ed from an article or group of articles. Despite this massive cluestick, Ed continued to engage in exactly the same behavior as prior to that RfAr to the point where Raul had to ban Ed from editing any articles related to [[intelligent design]]. This behavior makes me very worried about what would happen if Ed had access to the tools again. As Ed describes above, he started being involved in Wikipedia when the project was young. Since then the community has found need now three times to reduce how much trust it gives Ed to the point where his default level is much less than the level we give a new user. I therefore have a large amount of trouble thinking that giving Ed back the tools would be a net benefit to the project."

I really, really, really don't get the userbox issue.  Honestly don't get it.  It's 40px by 120px (or whatever).  It isn't the end of the world.  Would wikipedia be a better place if he had never put the userbox there?  Maybe.  But I can say that about almost any userbox that announces a personal opinion about the world.  I might be better off for not having seen the userbox, but the editor who placed it found it and put it there for a reason.  Likely, it was just a lark.  Or the user is happier for having put it on there.  It is, after all a volunteer project.  We do things in our userpace that are inside our comfort zones and most of the time that comfort zone is different than from our activities other places.  I might use the word ""fuck"" on my talk page.  It is pretty unlikely that I would use it on, say, the [[Miley Cyrus]] talk page.  If you think the userbox is polemical, [[WP:MFD|MfD]] is '''that way'''.  If you feel that it is not bad enough to merit deletion but crosses some invisible threshold of ""bad userboxen for admins"", please consider the impact that applying hidden and arbitrary conditions on adminship will have.  If you think that this userbox peers into the editor's soul and reveals his true prejudice...you should take a deep breath.  Because it doesn't.

You do a good job with images and with the mainspace, but you don't have enough experience in admin-related areas yet, with only 60 edits to the Wikipedia namespace. I see you used to have somewhat of a problem with edit summary usage, but I'm glad to see you rectified that.

Wikipedia works best as a collaborative encyclopedia and it would be much better to edit directly in article space because the edits may attract other editors who would have something to contribute.

I had a real problem finding any proof of consensus building and/or policy understanding.  Of his over 23,000 edits, over 20,000 are in the mainspace and would be deemed minor (but beneficial) edits. While 3000 non-mainspace edits is still an impressive total so I tried to dig into them.  During the last 5 month period, he has made 3 edits to Wikipedia Talk.  One of those [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_UK_Parliament_constituencies#Splitting_constituencies_for_UK.2FGB_Parliaments|edits]] he started the discussion, but never participated or followed up on the discussion.  Another [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Succession_Box_Standardization#Proposal:_modifications_to_Template:Succession_box|edit]] he made a drive by comment, but never appears to have revisited the discussion.  His [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Middle_Ages/Crusades_task_force#Holy_Leagues.3F|third edit]], the same thing.  All three of those discussions encountered extensive discussion after his contribution, but he didn't appear to be involved in them.  I got the definite sense that he is the type to make drive by contributions.  So I looked at the other places where he might be involved with.  During the same 5 months, he's made 100 edits to the talk space.  While there is minimal evidence of working on GA reviews, most are cosmetic edits such as redirects, name changes, or adding appropriate project tags.  I don't think there are but one or two where he made more than 5 edits!  In fact, in his 3.5 years of editing there is only one article where he has contributed to the talk page more than 10 times.  Similarly, in the past 5 months, he's only made about 100 edits to User Talk pages.  While there are a few people he communicates with on a semi-regular basis, his user talk contributions are sporatic and do not show consensus building nor do they demand policy knowledge.  So how about his participation ot the wikipedia space?  Once again, during the past 5 months, he's only made about 50 edits to the wikipedia space.  The contributions to these spaces indicate drive by participation in a number of areas as compared to establishing oneself and obtaining a solid understanding of any one area.  Thus, while he is a solid editor, I don't see the policy building or a demonstration of communicative skills I'd like to see from admins candidates.  I'm also worried about the apparent drive by nature of his communication style.  On a side note, I would suggest responding to discussions on the page where they begin, it really makes researching discussions a lot easier.---'''"

Seresin,RMHED,1,-1,2008,"00:37, 17 July 2008","I completely agree with Shereth. So he didn't follow the rules and closed debates that a section of a policy might disallow. Were any of these closures ''overturned as incorrect''? None have been listed. So, basically, what I'm getting from the oppose section is that even though he closes AfDs correctly, he [[WP:IAR|''doesn't follow the rules'']] and would therefore be a horrible sysop. That is absurd on its face. We are a wiki. We do not follow rules to follow rules. If the closes are a correct reading of consensus, then it does not matter who makes said closures. The next oppose reason is his attitude toward this RfA. Last time I checked, a common complaint was that people take adminship too seriously. And here we have someone who does quite clearly does not take it too seriously, and he is being opposed for it. This community is schizophrenic. And then there's the ageism (or adultism, if you prefer) opposes. Those are just ridiculous. Why on earth does believing that most young people are unfit to be an administrator make one unqualified to be an administrator? It doesn't. Like Doc Glasgow said, opposing someone because he is ageist is more stupid than opposing someone because of their age. '''"

FT2,Lawrence Cohen,0,-1,2008,"11:58, 7 April 2008","'''Comment and encouragement''' Lawrence focusses on improving the encyclopedia, and generally is a level voice on that score, making contributions in different areas. The concerns about a propensity for drama are ones I'm less familiar with, mostly as I don't track this user around the wiki. (I wasn't aware of his content work either.) In general, drama (the unnecessary choosing of heat over light, strident voices without much information, or hyping up of cases into trainwrecks) is completely to be avoided. It's hard enough to solve problems with good thoughtful input all around; the presence of yammering voices and vocal demands, often missing a chunk of the issue, is a prelude to disaster a lot of the time. Even for good reasons, that's to be avoided. My own [[User:FT2/RfA|preferences]] for administrators have a marked preference for ''problem solvers'' against problem ''antagonizers'', for good ''attitudes'', and for people who explain and enter dialog rather than fanatical approaches or politiking. In that light, I've reviewed my limited awareness of Lawrence, and some of the cited incidents/diffs above ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&oldid=203524372#Request_for_clarification:_User:Privatemusings][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_rollback/Vote&diff=prev&oldid=183564808][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_rollback/Vote&diff=prev&oldid=183575676]) and my own instinct still leans greatly towards ""tentative trust"", that this is a user who wants the project to be better and is willing to say so, and listen to others and be responsive, rather than bull-headedly ignoring other views. For example at RFAR/IRC, a heated drama-ridden case,  Lawrence stated firm views, but reasonably so, and they were analytically to the point and good questions, for the most part. For me that's crucial, it's a major distinction between people one can work with, and people one cannot easily work with. Likewise I remember discussing the npov noticeboard that he created, and I found him reasonable to talk to, aware of issues, and focussed upon project benefits even when told of possible difficulties.<br /><br />On the other hand, RFA concerns by a large number of users cannot be set aside because above all RFA is a test of communal trust, and each user measures trust their own way. That some 35% of users (at this time) have concerns enough to oppose, says to me that there is evidence the community is in doubt right now, and the reasons they give seem to be based on diffs not emotional whim. The doubts center around drama areas, getting ""drawn into disputes"" a bit much, and experience in judgement. There is nothing wrong with wanting to go to the real issues and get involved in them, so in a way this is about reassuring others, and that the aim is to address and solve problems rather than escalate them. There's a skill to that, which comes with experience. If this RFA does not pass, then I would urge Lawrence to definitely consider a second RFA in some months time... but to consider the concerns and advice of others (which I am sure he would do in any event) and possibly even seek a bit of mentoring or input when tough situations come up, to help round off his otherwise excellent input to the project. In summary, I suspect Lawrence is a user who works towards genuine resolutions of good quality (rather than say, carrying on when the matter is already closed), and people like that are often an asset to the project long term. He is already ""acting as an admin"", as the saying goes and seems to speak with integrity and a [[WP:CLUE|clue]]. I don't see him as a tool-misuser so it's all down to trust that he'll help reduce and not add tensions, and use RFA-ship (if granted) with good judgement. If he is the kind of person I think he is, he'll set himself to learn from the feedback on this page however it goes."

I don't believe Lawrence will misuse the tools in a way that will drive newbies away from the project as to my recollection he's never advocated blocking or deleting when smaller measures will do. I just reviewed his last 1000 Wikipedia space contributions and I think his behaviour in the Mantanmoreland case was exemplary. Furthermore, I wish more people would get involved in controversial topics instead of brushing it away with hand waving about how we should all get on and edit the encyclopedia. I don't see how it can be claimed that he's only interested in drama as he has FAs, Gas and DYKs to his name and has created a bunch of articles.

However, there are many lesser problems that cause me serious concern. After reading your three previous RfAs, I find that each one had a different one for failing. The [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/G1ggy|first one]] failed primarily for inexperience; however, if it had continued longer than it had, I believe the answer to Q4 would have caused it to fail instead. I find that answer a serious problem. Your [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Giggy|second one]] failed for the essay [[Wikipedia:Template the regulars]] and posting of private conversations on wiki. I agree that both of these incidents are cause for concern. Finally, [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Dihydrogen Monoxide|your most recent one]] had the most conerncing issues of all. Two concerns were your renames, and your views on who should be administrators. I don't particularly disagree with the latter, although how you phrased it could have been better, and I [[User:Seresin/name|clearly shouldn't]] comment on the former. The major concern, and in my mind most inexcusable, was the [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Digwuren/Evidence#Evidence presented by Bishonen|GA passing issue]]. That is not good behaviour at all. Finally, on this RfA, the TRE review. The first thing I noticed when reading it was your tendency to repeat other editors' off-wiki comments. It was very inappropriate to name those people without their consent. (I assume, based on their comments here, that this was not the case). In addition, the review was not civil, as AndonicO has said. These are the most prevalent concerns I've seen in your RfAs. These issues, combined with an overarching theme of lack of maturity and poor judgment, plus other little things here and there in opposing comments of your RfAs cause me enough concern to oppose your RfA. I am sorry about this, really. I wanted to support you, but I cannot in good conscience do so with the concerns I listed above. You are an excellent article writer, and I hope that you continue to do so, and after several months of addressing these concerns, (or at least giving enough time after them to show you've changed your habits) and editing, I hope you have another RfA I can support.

I don't see anything in the opposes that show that he hasn't learned from whatever mistakes he's made, none of them major. In fact, I don't trust someone that hasn't made at least some mistakes, since it shows overwhelming risk avoidance, not something we want in this job. Ideally make some mistakes and learn from them. The only real issue in an RfA is can the community trust this person with the tools that, in the wrong hands, can do considerable damage. Also, I trust the co-nominators and other supporters, too many to name without leaving someone out. The fact he turned down nominations also speaks well for him. He has my trust.

Travellingcari,RyRy,-1,-1,2008,"02:48, 25 August 2008","'''Oppose''', also a great deal of thought because I've seen this coming. First I want to say that he has come a long way -- especially with DYKs, but I still have concerns. Three main reasons for oppose: 1) ties in with the trophy Metros mentions -- over and over RyRy has said he wasn't going to do this for a good amount of time but now because people have asked he's ""given in."" This speaks to his maturity and ability to know when the time is right. It raises concerns that someone blocked may ask repeatedly and he'll agree to unblock before it's time as well. It also ties into the need for ""acceptance"" and repeated requests until the person gives in. Being an admin requires a great deal of initiative to take the right action without asking everyone for OK before doing it. Need for validation so frequently is not a sign of someone ready to handle admin duties. The second reason is sadly beyond Ryan's control. During the recent months when he's worked to improve his Wiki skills, and I agree these have improved, he worked with Steve Crossin. Given recent issues, I find the need to question the guidance Steve provided. I think that in his quest to learn more about Wikipedia (a good thing), he may have unwittingly learnt some bad habits. While this is not a huge reason to oppose, it raises a red flag for me right now. That said, I know he has worked with Useight and Baloonman and I believe they have helped him to learn good habits. 3) While Ryan understands that he can't create copyvios and while there are things he did that resulted in the loss of rollback, I'm not sure he understands why they're wrong. I think he's learnt not to do that exact thing again, but I don't think he gets the bigger picture of why not to do something. I suggest more ""study"" and a decent amont of time between RFAs if this doesn't pass. I thik Ryan will be ready at some point, I don't think now is the time. <font face=""Verdana""><font color=""Blue"">"

Maxim and Balloonman are right about the joke, and I wouldn't like such an attitude in an admin. I am, though, concerned about the answer to Q1. Why request admin tools if you'll barely ever use them? Plasticup is an excellent contributor, but doesn't seem to need adminship or to have the right attitude about it. Adminship is no big deal, but there are some expectations with regard to RfA candidates. There's no reason to pile on here, though - this RfA will probably fail anyway, and I find it somewhat annoying when hordes of users vote on the oppose section of a request for adminship, especially when the user is a good contributor and the RfA has practically [[WP:SNOW|snowed]] anyway."

HisSpaceResearch,MONGO,1,-1,2008,"21:34, 21 January 2008","'''Weak support'''. MONGO seems highly experienced and has contributed a lot of good work to the project, and this needs to be kept in mind. However, the diffs provided below do concern me somewhat. I think he could use the admin tools well, which is why I'm supporting, but I'm slightly concerned that he might misuse them with deletions and blocking - for example, with the [[Salty Walrus]] article, since I'm not an admin I can't see the deleted content, but an article about a slang term for a sexual act describing it as such in a coherent manner does not meet any of the [[WP:CSD]] such as G1 [[WP:PN|patent nonsense]], even if it's obviously not a notable term, violating [[WP:V]], [[WP:N]], [[WP:WINAD]] and possibly [[WP:NOR]], this still isn't a speedy delete - that's just part of the deletion process which we go through (there is also [[WP:SNOW]] though, which I believe is a controversial issue). I must also say that becoming involved in disputes or controversy is definitely not a valid reason to oppose someone becoming an administrator. For example, I believe that MONGO's statements during the controversy surrounding Encyclopedia Dramatica, and the off-wiki [[WP:ATP|attack page]] about MONGO on ED were perfectly justified. He was also absolutely right to support the deletion of the ED article, because the website itself lacks non-trivial third party coverage in reliable sources - certainly not enough to have an article with much information at all without violating [[WP:NOR]] - I would support having an article on ED if third-party coverage was significant enough to allow for an encyclopedia article, but it's not at the moment. The reason we don't have an article on it is because it fails [[WP:V]], not because it's a controversial topic.--'''"

I agree with Seresin on many points, and having looked at the admin page of iMatthew, I would expect a candidate to know that IP's cannot create pages and most of that stuff. Also, consensus on local articles almost certainly does not override Wikipedia-wide consensus, same with the MOS I guess - a particular project cannot have a MoS that is 100% against Wikipedia MoS. As a suggestion to the Candidate, I would suggest exploring new areas on Wiki, ""Widening the Wings"" I'd call it to gain more experience. I'm almost certain, should this fail, that you'll learn from past errors/mistakes and pass the next RFA with flying colours."

In fact, the Barnstars and smiles suggest that the user is helpful, friendly and courteous. When an oversight is called to the nominee's attention, he thanks the editor for bringing it to his attention and seeks to improve with the experience. '''He is clearly the sort of person it will be a pleasure to have as an admin'''. Since the last RfA, he has broadened his experience beyond article building to include AfD as well.

His answer to question 4 is irrelevant to his readiness for adminship because the question, regarding a controversial matter lacking in community consensus, is lirrelevant.

After reviewing your contribs, I feel that, percentage wise, your ""error rate"" (and there are definitely errors) is ''extremely low'', and your ""rescuse rate"" (as evidenced in your answer to Question #2) far outweighs your ""accidents"" in adding a speedy G3 to an open AFD (it's one of my pet peeves actually, because it means the article will get speedied, instead of AFd-deleted.  Someone asked ""what's the difference?""  The difference is, if the ''community'' decides it's supposed to be a redlink, if/when it gets recreated, it can be speedy G4'd without significant improvements.  When the redlink of a previous ''speedy'' goes blue again, it can't be re-speedied - let the AFDs run!).  Anywho, yes, you've made some errors.  Tyere are lots of diffs down there in the next session, some old, some recent, some personal grudges, all legitimate.  I agree with most of them that they are true errors.  The only thing I can say you are ""guilty"" of though is that you are prolific and passionate in that area of the wiki.  I strongly believe your ""error rate"" is likely below 5%, if not below 1% and will be even lower once you are ""more careful"" as an admin.  For every bad diff, I could probably find 95-99 good ones, in other words.  If you become an admin, you will still make errors, don't let anyone tell you that an ""admin error"" is ""harder to reverse"" or ""more damaging"" or whatnot.

I like the CSD tags I'm seeing here. In deleted contributions, on the blatant hoax [[:Cheetah Gazelle]], the nom even corrected a misapplied {{tl|db-nonsense}} tag with the more proper {{tl|db-vandalism}}. This gives me confidence that he is, indeed, ""very familiar with speedy deletion"" and more importantly has thought about what the criteria mean and how to apply them. Particularly in light of Pedro's oppose below, I looked back at his contributions at ANI through mid December of 2007, and every report the nom has filed there except [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism&diff=prev&oldid=183723098 one he himself removed] was subsequently blocked. This suggests to me that, if he has had imperfect judgment in the past, he seems to have the idea now. (The one that he removed does seem to have been an over-reaction. I'm glad he rethought that and would encourage him not to overreact in similar circumstances in the future. That doesn't strike me as a credible death threat. :)) Every name he has reported at UAA since the first of January has resulted in a block. That said, I would encourage this nom (if he receives the tools) to avoid name blocking in anything but the most clear cut circumstances, given that his report of ""monosex"" was only on December 24th. --"

Irpen,DeadEyeArrow,-1,1,2008,"02:04, 15 March 2008","'''Oppose'''. Too much emphasis on policing and vandal-fighting and too little on creating content. I will elaborate for those who attack such reasons. I am well aware that some think that content-writing does not matter much to understand Wikipedia. Not surprisingly, such opinion is common in the non-writing but rather chatting and socializing quarters. Arguments are well known. Moreover, a small minority of non-writing admins are actually good ones. However, the wrong judgment and especially the wrong attitude towards other editors are much more common among the admins with little interest in content creation but a greater interest in being in a position to tell others what to do, ""run"" wikipedia and chat-a-lot. The admins often have to make a judgment on the issues that very much affect the article writers who are mostly concerned about the content. Appreciating these concerns is very difficult without a significant involvement in the content creation. At least one must demonstrate a significant interest in the content creation even if lack of time prevents one from contributing much at the time. Answers to questions about 3RR suggests that the candidate plans to get involved in critical decisions that would affect content and ''content editors''. The ""wikipedia-runners"" patrolling 3RR, ANI, etc. prescribing blocks and making rulings (often above our policies) make a srong net-negative impact on the Wikipedia, which is an encyclopedia first of all rather than an internet site for other activities. --"

Iridescent,Philosopher,-1,1,2008,"16:46, 30 April 2008","'''Oppose''' - Dorftrottel puts it better than I could.

And to echo the two above me, while it wouldn't be a deal-breaker, I also loathe declarations of religious and/or political affiliations. I'm distinctly unimpressed with the editcountitis (the statement on your userpage that ""This user believes that a user's edit count does not necessarily reflect on the value of their contributions to Wikipedia"" would be a bit more convincing if it wasn't right underneath one of those ridiculous ""[[Wikipedia:Service awards|service badges]]"" and a list of your 1000th, 2000th etc edits).

Justallofthem,Cirt,-1,1,2008,"01:45, 14 September 2008","'''Strong Oppose''' - Believe or not I really wrestled for a long time with this one. I wanted to give Cirt the benefit of the doubt and !vote ""neutral"". I even toyed with the idea of !voting ""support"". What brought me to my senses was Cirt's response ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Cirt&diff=next&oldid=238088238 here]) only a few paragraphs above this. It demonstrated clearly that whatever sense of judgment Cirt might possess that qualifies him to be an admin here goes right out the window when Cirt's own self-interests are involved. And that is what worries me most when a confirmed and dedicated POV-warrior puts on a happy face and makes of bunch of friends. I refer of course to Cirt's response above to the sock [[User:ShadowVsScientology]] (see [[Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Richard Rolles]]). In [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FCirt&diff=238085713&oldid=238077887 the pair of edits] the sock attacks me as a paid propagandist working for OSA and proceeds to explain that he knows all about the IP attack on my userpages. It does not take a rocket scientist to realize that this is just another sock of the same character that was doing most of the attacking, {{userlinks|Richard Rolles}}. Just look over his contribs - there are only six of them, and those of the first sock {{userlinks|Ken Moxon}}. Would any of you admins here have missed that? Cirt was very involved with all of this and in fact referenced it in his response to my Q.15. He pointed at specific related off-wiki posts in his response to the sock. There are simple to follow clues in those posts to the source of that attack and the sockmaster there including a name similar to this current sock. But he should not have even needed to go off-wiki, it is obvious to anyone that looks at the posts of the sockmaster and the current sock that they the same individual as was confirmed by checkuser. And even if, by some stretch, Cirt's admining instincts are so bad that he could not spot that then why in the world does he respond to the post by providing clarifying information rather than address the personal and off-topic attack on me, and to a much lesser extent, himself. To try to a score point as a ""neutral editor""? Anyone that thinks Cirt is neutral on the subject of Scientology is clueless indeed. Cirt is careful, not neutral. Careful not to get caught. Cirt repeatedly and routinely puts this project second where his own self-interest and biases are concerned. Witness his recent unwillingness to grasp the basics of [[WP:BLP]] and what constitutes a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] at [[Talk:David Miscavige]]. Cirt repeatedly championed the inclusion of libelous and poorly-sourced material in that article [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Miscavige&diff=235123592&oldid=235083243 1] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:David_Miscavige&diff=235164655&oldid=235133194 2] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:David_Miscavige&diff=next&oldid=235164655 3], even to the extent of suggesting it be included as an EL after it was clear that it was not going in the article [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:David_Miscavige&diff=236563618&oldid=236558775 4].

If an editor has trouble staying cool at baseline, the problem is going to be a hundred times worse when they become an admin and get a big target painted on their back.

He also seems unable to admit fault and I'm not sure I like all the adolescent backslapping at WR he participates in.  All the endless carping about his Arbcom sanctions, his relentless negative interactions with Phil Sandifer, his insistence on changing the way Wikipedia is governed...the list goes on.

So if you boil it down to ""will he abuse the tools"", I think the answer is probably not. Ironically, outside of one or two instances of fork bendingly bad judgment, I think he has a better idea of how an admin fits into the grand scheme of things here then many current admins (especially those from the last year or two). And it is true that much of the considerable trouble he's gotten into has been acting as an editor and not using administrator tools.

On one hand, Kumioko is, per Majorly and the other supporting editors, an excellent article contributor, and that very often provides an administrator with robust inter-editor communication skills. It could also suggest that he'd be competent at article-related administrator duties, such as protection. Having said that, we also have an editor who has very little administrator-related-activities experience, insofar as I can observe, and that brings some doubts into the equation for me: I fear Kumioko may not have a sufficient grasp of admin. duties, and may (unintentionally, of course) cause damage through some bad calls. Whilst I'm sure that would improve with time, it concerns me: there's simply not enough experience here. Perhaps if Kumioko could expand on the RfA standard questions with some strong answers, I'd be willing to support, but at present, they are very thin, and really don't do anything to sway me to support. On the fence for this one, depending on a response from Kumioko (which I'd be very happy to see forthcoming), and further developments."

Anyway, I don’t find any of the concerns raised in the oppose section convincing: in the past, we’ve had vandal-fighters nominated for adminship, they’ve been successful, and have gone onto be great admins. The communication issues are understandable, but in my dealings with Aitias, as I said in my statement, I’ve found him to be reasonable when talking to him. It should be noted that people who focus heavily on reverting vandalism ''will have'' a lot of templated talk-page messages in their editing histories, and the fact he’s notifying people when he’s reverted their vandalism or nominated their page for speedy deletion is a ''good thing''. I should also remind people that there are other prolific vandal-fighters like Aitias who are admins: DerHexer (who is also a steward), KnowledgeOfSelf, Alex.muller, Persian Poet Gal, and Can’t sleep, clown will eat me, just to name a few: these people are heavy vandal-fighters, and they are all highly respected users, with use of the tools that has been excellent; I think Aitias will be the same, and therefore standby my nomination and support.

The reason for that tag is that if a user uploads an image that he or she created and does not provide a license (GFDL, CC-BY-SA, etc), then we have no idea what his or her intentions were for licensing reuse of the image or even if he or she has such intentions.  So we use that tag.  But media being used under a claim of fair use is unlicensed anyway.  In probably fewer keystrokes than you can add {{tls|nld}}, you can correct the problem by simply adding the correct boilerplate fair use tag.  Tagging these things for deletion instead of adding the correct tag only creates busy work.  I am also unimpressed with [[Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Wheels for willys|this SSP report]], which again, only creates busy work.

The reason that you're being asked to come back after some time has passed is because the community wants to see if you are knowledgeable about wikipedia's policies.

Coppertwig's reply was weak and vacillating - newbie Netiquette means not jumping into things you don't understand, and when it involves threats of policy violations, something a little stronger than ""blah, blah, blah, try to reach consensus"" is required, and it can be done while maintaining civility.

OK, whatever, one can legitimately argue about how long a discussion should be open. But then he then says that ""I am not yet convinced that this user's actions warrant a ban... Perhaps Giovanni could be asked to avoid a particular article, if that article is a source of controversy?"" If Everyking had taken two seconds to actually read the discussion, he'd be aware the user in question was caught socking by RFCU (and indeed was shortly banned by ArbCom for mass socking). It requires an utter lack of clue to suggest that a bitter, months-long conflict with a sockpuppeter could be resolved by ''politely asking him to avoid an article'' - Giovanni was not being accused of disruptive actions on his own account, the disruption was with socks he refused to own up to in the first place. -"

Of greatest concern to me is this use of [[WP:CSD#A7]] on February 9th: [[Sweetcorn icecream]]. The entire contents of the article when he tagged it were ""Sweetcorn ice cream originated from Malaysia (Clarke 2004) is one of the strangest and most exotic flavoured ice cream ever made. Its existence has been very much debated by rachel. In each delectable spoonful you'll find juicy pieces of this signature fruit of paradise. blended with the purest ingredients, sweet, luscious corn create a tropical delight."" [[WP:CSD#A7]] says, ""A7 applies only to articles about web content or articles on people and organizations themselves, not articles on their books, albums, software and so on. Other article types are not eligible for deletion by this criterion."" No argument on the quality of this article, but it was patently not an A7 candidate. Similarly, within the last several weeks, he tagged [[Dick chop]] and [[Laurie Ferron]] as {{tl|db-nocontext}}. The former read ""Dick chop is a shock video, made by Bme pain olympics, of a man who removes his penis and testicals."" and the latter ""LAURIE FERRON: best known for being a french model."" A1 says, in full, that it is for ""Very short articles lacking sufficient context to identify the subject of the article."" I can recognize the subject of both of these quite easily. I also see several instances of articles which he tagged for deletion under [[WP:CSD#A3]] as ""no content"" within a minute of creation. [[WP:CSD]] notes that ""Contributors sometimes create articles over several edits, so try to avoid deleting a page too soon after its creation if it appears incomplete."" The nom has made ''many'' good tags and seems to do generally very good work on Wikipedia, but ''does'' indicate that this is one of the ""two main areas"" that he knows ""most about"". I would feel more comfortable supporting with evidence that the nom knows it better. I believe that speedy deletions are often overly liberally applied—a complaint we see quite often at the talk page for CSD—and that anyone seeking adminship, particularly with the stated rationale of desiring to pursue them, should demonstrate full understanding of policy before receiving the tools. --"

Count Iblis,Headbomb,1,-1,2008,"16:05, 23 June 2008","'''Support''' I think that Headbomb would be an excellent adminstrator. He has done a lot of work for wiki project physics and  can be trusted with Admin tools. His interactions with other editors so far have been exemplary. The real test here is how you deal with a problematic editor who makes outrageous comments. As I explained in my comment below oppose vote #18, he passed that test with flying colors.<br>There are a few valid reasons one might be concerned, these are mentioned in oppose votes #3, #4, and #20, basically lack of experience I think, however, that that lack of experience is not a big concern here. Headbomb will work mainly on the physics articles and unlike most of the rest of wikipedia, that's a peaceful sector of wikipedia. For an Admin to be able to function effectively here, it is much more important that the Admin is a physicist than that he is a battle hardened wikipedian. In fact, given the permanent state of war many wiki politics articles are in, one has to question the relevance of many of the criteria that are used to approve a RFA in general.<br>Will Headbomb abuse his Admin Powers to settle content disputes in articles he is involved in? Again, this is not a potential problem. It would be if Headbomb were very active on political subjects, because then there are usually two sides to an issue and for POV reasons you don't what an Admin to be a fanatical supporter of one side. In the case of scientific articles, an involved Admin is usually not a problem because the nature of disputes on scientific topics is usually completely different. Usually one side is wrong, the other side is right and you really do not want the side who is wrong to get any foothold in the article. That requires the Admin to have at least some background in the topic. The [[Global warming]] article is a very good example of how involved Admins (Connoley and Raul) can be very effective<br>So, all this leads me to conclude that Headbomb should be allowed to  become an Admin. I also note that there are only 3 votes based on valid arguments against, so perhaps this RFA should be closed and he should be given Admin status right now?"
LessHeard vanU,Risker,1,1,2008,"20:58, 10 May 2008","'''Very Strong Support''' To be honest, it is the oppose arguments (but not the arguers) who cite the strong opinions and the strange affliction of ""wikilawyering"" (i.e. the willingness to test the understanding of policy, to ensure that all aspects have been covered, in a debate) in their decisions that has persuaded me to vote early (when I first found out I was toying with holding on and trying to be [[WP:100]].) I am biased, but I sincerely believe that a candidate who is committed to the encyclopedia and yet is prepared to get into the protracted debates and hold an unpopular opinion on the basis that it is important to provide a full vista of argument is one that is needed. ''""Too much drama!""'' is sometimes shorthand for, ''""Too much hard work, why can't we just act and move on?""'' Even where this is considered a Bad Thing, does this willingness to ask the awkward question or take the unpopular position translate as an inability to use the sysop bits appropriately? Has this editor been found to violate Wikipedia principles or policy? I say no, and thus believe that this candidate is a great example of the type of free thinking individual that should be part of the admin community. Case in point; it has come to me, as it has for many, as a surprise to find that Risker is female - evidence that the individual has devoted much of their time to the project, and not used it as a medium for promoting themselves. It makes the point that Risker has only ever debated upon facts and interpretation of policy, and never on who they are."

AGK,Geni,1,-1,2008,"18:03, 16 March 2008","I have given this request a great deal of thought, and my primary inclination is to '''support''' the request. Geni has come on a great deal since he was originally desysopped during the Arbitration decision at [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Daniel Brandt deletion wheel war]]: he has presented an exemplary level of civility in inter-editorial communications, and has been happy to handle enquiries concerning his on-Wiki contributions. I find it encouraging that he has not appeared hasty to regain the administrator tools, although he has been happy to participate in the type of duties that one often sees in administrators: [[WP:SPAM|spam links]] patrolling ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atcham&diff=prev&oldid=179763524]), policy development ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Verifiability&diff=prev&oldid=188495425]), etc... Geni has not been afraid to voice his opinion on matters since he lost his administrator bit, which is similarly encouraging: it is all too easy to revert to ""perfect wikipedian"" mode in preparation for a re-sysopping RfA, and the fact that he has remained an honest, fair editor, who is not afraid to hold down the truth, for fear of opposition at a future RfA seems to suggest that he will not be afraid to undertake non-routine actions, so long as they benefit the project. All things considered, I am confident that Geni's regaining the access to the administrator tools will benefit the project as a whole. I would advise him to be more careful in the future, and to avoid a repeat of the Brandt incident—having said that, I don't think Geni is stupid enough to wheel war a second time. Good luck with your RfA: it will be a controversial one, but one that I hope you can pull through successfully.

TigerShark,TenPoundHammer,-1,-1,2008,"01:27, 21 March 2008","'''Oppose''' The answer to Q10 is worrying, not because a mistake was made, but because the nominee still doesn't seem to understand just how far of the mark he was or seem to be overly concerned that his reasoning was wrong, when he says: '''''""Maybe it wasn't quite blatant enough for a G3 (A1 probably would've been closer, as the page only comprised one sentence), but the page was deleted and turned into a dab anyway.""''''' It was absolutely nowhere near being a blatant hoax, and just because the page was eventually deleted doesn't negate the fact that it was incorrectly nominated in the first place. This leads me to doubt his judgement at the moment with respect to deletions. If this failure of judgement was itself a one-off, then it would perhaps be OK, but it seems that this has been a major concern for others at least as far back as his last RFA. Because his answer to Q1 indicates that deletion related work will be his focus, and that this is the are where he has the strongest knowledge - I think the nominee needs a bit more time before getting the tools. He can add a lot of value now, but somebody with a little more experience needs to review his nominationa before the delete button is hit."

Walton One,Redfarmer,0,-1,2008,"17:02, 3 April 2008","'''Neutral, leaning support''' per Pedro. Speedy deletion is one of the areas of admin work where care and good judgment are essential; although any deletion is reversible in seconds, an inappropriate speedy may drive away an inexperienced user who is confused as to why their new article was deleted, and may never even be noticed or brought to DRV. It is therefore essential IMO that an administrator should fully understand [[WP:CSD]], and, in particular, should not interpret CSD A7 too broadly (as Redfarmer did in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mazza_Gallerie&diff=202176299&oldid=202176227 this diff] cited by Pedro above).
