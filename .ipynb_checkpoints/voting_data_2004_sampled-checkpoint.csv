Lady Lysine Ikinsile,Snowspinner,0,1,2004,,"<s>Well, after some consideration, I am compelled to oppose here.  I do not often vote in such things, but I am not at all certain I agree with many of this user's views on WP administration, particularly regarding resolution of disputes without recourse to enforced procedure and regulations.  Specific examples include Avala's RfAr evidence (which, while not containing any specific objections which would on their own disqualify a user from adminship, exemplifies my general feelings), and an opinion that mediation is not helpful; however, I also have a broad non-specific objection to hir general attitude and opinions in such matters.  While adminship should be something bestowed upon anyone willing to enforce the community's decisions, rather than an ability to enforce one's own views, there is at present a certain status associated with adminship and it does result in one's own opinions, however inadvertantly, carrying more weight than a normal user's.  I therefore cannot personally support adminship for those whose desired procedures differ so much from my own. [[User:Lady Lysine Ikinsile|&mdash;''Lady Lysi&#0331;e Iki&#0331;sile'']] | [[User talk:Lady Lysine Ikinsile|Talk]] 00:27, 2004 Jul 29 (UTC)</s>  Having considered this further, I am changing my vote to neutral; not because my opinion has changed, but because I do not feel comfortable opposing a nomination on the grounds that I personally disagree with the direction the community is taking.  The solution to the exhalted admin status seems to be in having more admins, not less."

That said, the situation required tact and care that he didn't display. Adding more potentially libelous statements to Wikipedia was not entirely helpful.

Though I do not doubt his initial intention to remain objective, in the mediation he publicly slipped a number of times in being overly deferential to one party and made several explicit and implied statements favoring one party in the mediation, both on User talk pages and by email. His NPOV in the dispute was far from complete/optimal. Hawstom also was unaware of the wikipolicy on [[Wikipedia:Refactoring#When_to_refactor|Refactoring]], a policy central to the allegations, and only became aware of it when I pointed it out. His method for resolving the dispute was lengthy, inefficient and did not produce tangible results. Questionable tactics employed by one party in the mediation went unchecked by Hawstom, as did a number of ad hominems. Additionally, Hawstom failed to respond/reply to my 5 emails sent in reply to his contacting me. When asked about this, he promised to respond to them but still has not. In defense of Hawstom he had a prior friendly working relationship with the defendant, so remaining genuinely neutral would have been a real struggle for anyone. But that also causes me to wonder why Hawstom initiated the mediation (I did not seek it), and that he mediate it, in the first place.--"

But he takes the time to argue his cases in talk pages, without reverting to name calling or what I would call verbal abuse - and in my opinion he brings up strong and good arguments. Ultimately, he has also stepped down on issues such as the [[Miss Kitty Fantastico]] ""chocolate box"" link. He is passionate, but in my judgement based on what I've read of his heated interactions, he does not let his passion carry him past the red lines, and he is capable of compromise. He strikes me also as intelligent and pedantic in the good sense. I see nothing in his behaviour that leads me to believe he will abuse his administrative powers, and I've seen several current administrators who are more argumentative and agressive than this user."

I don't think he's a bad guy but we've butted heads over his inability to understand what NPOV means even in the most basic sense. As reference, see our discussions on [[Talk:Robert Oppenheimer]] (a few months ago), [[Talk:Wernher von Braun]] (a few months ago), and [[Talk:Nazi Germany]] (last week, when he suggested, and defended, his use of a self-described holocaust/historical denial website as a valid source for resolving a minor squabble). I think he is an earnest contributor but I don't think he has very good negotiation skills, good historical reasoning, or good methodology. And I think he has some legitimate conceptual problems with understand what NPOV means in any applicable sense. If you want to see this in practice, again, view my frustrations on [[Talk:Robert Oppenheimer]]. Sorry, GeneralPatton, nothing against you personally, you seem like a nice enough guy, and I don't think you ''mean'' to antagonize, but I think you often just don't ''get'' what Wikipedia articles should be about in a very fundamental way, and I haven't really seen any improvement in this, to be honest. I haven't seen you use good editing judgment or communication skills. These seem to me to be rather important for any administrator position, even with as lack-of-status as it is supposed to be. Even if the user has reformed since last July (which my latest disagreement with him suggests to me that he has not), I see this as being a somewhat provisional state and definitely not compelling a vote for adminship. (I'm someone who sometimes has strong opinions about uses of historical sources and statements, so please read the discussions linked and decide for yourself, don't just take my word for it.) --"

All of us encounter opposition to our views, some if it from users who many find turbulent.  The views of all non-banned, non-sock puppet users count equally, and Neutrality's belief that common sense dictates against counting Rex071404's vote doesn't square well either with policy or my sense of fair play. I've had my run-ins with VV myself, but VV's opinion counts too, whether or not VV has a ""grudge"" against anyone. It appears that Neutrality is intent on having the last word with his/her critics, which often isn't the best strategy toward ensuring long-term wikipeace. Lastly, it's important that the record of discussions such as this be as accurate as possible, and even subtle changes such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&diff=5230097&oldid=5230021 this edit] make me uncomfortable (I'm fine with strikeouts, however).  --"

Sorting his contribs another way (by article title) shows no long-term committments to any - rarely more than 2 edits at most.

Geogre,Snowspinner,-1,1,2004,"17:53, 29 Jul 2004","It is a reluctant opposition and does not reflect any personal feelings I might have toward Snowspinner's past or continuing contributions to the site and project.  However, I reviewed the evidence against Avala, and I felt that there were a number of occasions when an appeal to a broader community might have easily forestalled the animosity.  Avala's English is not fluent, and he is a citizen of the former Yugoslavia.  Consequently, some of his arguments were hampered by the language barrier, but, additionally, many of Snowspinner's misunderstandings were caused by not seeking out other, more fluent, English speakers from the area to help negotiate opinions.  After a certain point, it seems like the fight was about the fighting, and not about any particular issue, article, or decision.  That it reached such a point without outreach, without seeking the aid of neutral parties, does reflect somewhat poorly on Snowspinner's reactions to a belligerant fellow editor.  Finally and ultimately, though, I feel that Snowspinner's time on Wikipedia is simply too brief.  I say this not because I believe there is a magic number of days or edits, but because the motivation to move to administrator quickly worries me.  If one's desire is based upon getting one's will, then it is bad.  If one's desire is based upon changing the course of the project, that, too, is bad.  If one's desire is to particpate in a social world of admins, then, I feel, the motivation is suspect.  Only if the desire is based upon duty and a belief that the project is far more important than any of the project's participants is it appropriate.  I do not in any way whatever mean to imply that I believe that Snowspinner's motives are bad.  In fact, I think Snowspinner is a reasonable, intelligent, and dilligent contributor to the project who has shown himself of the highest commitment.  Instead, I oppose because I feel that it takes a great deal of time as a regular user to show a person's continued perseverance and to establish how such a person will react to others in opposition.  I do not think there is enough of a track record.  Hoping by all means that I offer no offense and provoke only thought,"

Sadly, though, Lucky's temper, especially with newbies, is seemingly incompatible with the role and responsibilities of an admin.  I am very open to the possibility that Lucky will find better ways of communicating displeasure, and gentler methods of working with new users -- I opposed Mike H, way back when, out of a concern for the way he handled disputes, and I'm now pleased to say I think he's very good at it and I was happy to support him when he was renominated.

I don't think this is the case with you, but I don't want to set a bad precedent.  If you're not an admin by the second week of April, I'll nominate you myself."

While Rei has a number of excellent edits, the most valuable of which are on mushroom-related topics, most of her recent edits have been at politically charged current-events articles, such as [[Oil for food]], [[George W.

Yes, he has over 2,600 edits, but looking at his last 100 contributions there are only about seven edits to ''articles''. He may only have a few hundred article edits altogether. Paradoxically, this appears to be the very reason he has received so much support as opposed to the other nominees on this page - at least I can find no other explanation (if I'm wrong, maybe some who supported Snowspinner but not the others can explain their voting) other than that he is simply better known, and this is because the average ""Wikipedia:"" page is more widely read than the average article (and article edits are not signed). I find it troubling, however, that this way we tend to create a class of ""professional sysops"" who are merely supervising the actual editors who work on the articles. And I note that Snowspinner is already running for the Arbitration Committee, which I don't see as a good sign. Everyone here should be an editor in the first place, and the administrative tasks should be shared among editors, not entrusted to a separate class who does little else but administrating."

In his defense, Chris has changed a lot from the person he was when he arrived here: I appreciate all he's done to adapt to the way we work here, and I think that needs commending.  But on the flip side, Chris had a lot of issues when arriving here (for a few days I thought we had [[User:JoeM|JoeM]]'s counterpart), and his great strides have not yet completely resolved things for me.  I still worry that Chris seeks out articles where he is most biased, thereby putting himself in the way of edit wars.  I worry also about the copyright issues, which Chris still seems far too nonchalant about to me.  And I will say that, while Chris is much better about avoiding disputes, I have not yet seen him be active about defusing disputes, which is an important difference -- an admin should not simply be ""mostly not in trouble"", but show some skill at preventing trouble (of course, Chris may be doing these things, but I haven't seen it).  I believe Chris, in a month or two, would be a good choice, but at this point I am not fully comfortable supporting him.  Hang in there, Chris: a couple more months should put a lot of the opposition behind you, especially if you try to address the concerns being voiced.  And should the vote go Chris's way, I'll take that as a sign that my concerns have indeed been addressed, and I just haven't been around to see it happen (I haven't interacted much with Chris in the last 3-4 weeks)."

I agree with Neutrality's stance in the edits over [[John Kerry]], as ""Swift Boat Veterans for Truth"" have made clear (as well as ongoing ""books"" coming from the partisan side), there really is a war over such words as ""minor wound.""  These words, which by themselves seem innocent of all intent, are massively POV in the current environment, because some folks on the right are trying to get all the media to talk about the factuality of the wound or the medal/ribbon toss or whatever else, rather than service vs. non-service.  However, the fact that the partisan debate in the outer world so quickly became a pitched battle in this virtual world -- one that has continued here -- and the readiness of both sides to employ fictional users or dopplegangers, makes me say that the truth of Neutrality's abilities are obscurred so thoroughly that I cannot support or oppose.  If all Neutrality's opponents were wrong, it would, in a sense, make no difference, because he has become a polarizing actor.  If the problem is with his opponents, then the ArbCom rulings will sort that out.  Until then, the amount of heat surrounding this debate is enough to dissuade me from voting support."
