It's been less than 2 weeks since this business with his User page started, and by his own admission, he put the materials there because of his unfamiliarity w/ the logistics of WP.  This isn't a ''bad'' thing, but it's not a ''good'' thing for an admin, especially when Ed's rationale is so that BYT can do everything he (Ed) can.  In addition, while BYT has been exceptionally diplomatic here, this has not always been the case in his discussions with other users on various talk pages, where he has sometimes been openly confrontational.  Finally, I am somewhat concerned by what I regard as his possibly dubious grasp of NPOV on issues close to his heart.

Hermione is a prime example of applying editcount criteria for adminship can lead us to make poor decisions.  While the number of her edits is comparatively low, looking through them one can see a few things:  (1) the quality of her contributions is uniformly high.  This is someone who is careful and deliberate, and takes each submit seriously.  Such people are naturally going to have a lower edit count than someone else (like, uh, me) who fires off edits in staccato bursts.  (2) She has been here for a long time, and demonstrated her commitment to the project.  (3) Her willingness to seek consensus (for example, via article RfCs) rather than just hammering her opinions home mindlessly is great.

I don't think this RfA should be turned into an RfC on the AfD &ndash; what a lot of abbreviations! In my view, the timing of it showed poor judgment from a would-be admin for his own sake, but if it had been done in bad faith, he would surely have waited until the RfA was over. It's worth noting, also, that ScottyBoy is not the only one to recruit votes [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Private_Butcher&diff=prev&oldid=25306810]. I would hope that anyone who feels that the [[David Mertz]] article should be kept would vote accordingly in the [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/David Mertz|appropriate place]], rather than here. By the way, I'm voting neutral because I don't know enough about ScottyBoy to decide whether or not he'd be a good admin. One piece of advice I'd give is that you need to use edit summaries more frequently. Your nomination will probably pass next time. Good luck!"

She also knows how to respect consensus even when it goes against her as well as how to compromise in order to achieve it.

Other points against include the user's bizarre talk page policy--keeping paths of dialogue open is highly important for an admin in particular, and that RfC isn't exactly ancient history.  My advice: keep up the good work in article space, lose the volatility, encourage talk-page communication, and come back when the RfC ''is'' ancient history.  At the moment, there's just too many negatives to seriously consider supporting this candidate."

Plus, 20 articles going to vfd is a ton for someone without that many edits. Like was said earlier, one or 2 is ok but 20? Plus, I'm not sure he knows what admins do. I would strongly suggest reading the [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_reading_list|Administrators reading list]] so you have some understanding about what admins do. Reading the answers to the questions, it sounds like the user thinks that being an admin is something you should be given for good deeds. It doesn't quite work that way. It's more of using it for things such as vfds or for conflict resolution. It isn't really a reward for goodness. You need to show that you will use the powers and use them well. And also, the ""checkered past"" bothers me as well. I appreciate the honesty, but that indicates a willingness to get into conflict.

For example, such as Kate, who created Kate's tool and offers solid logic, but anyone is entitled to a few mistakes (and his actions may ''not'' have been inappropriate?? -his explanations seem reasonable). Additionally, a person who has developer privileges is trusted to a higher level than is an admin. Editors are making too much of a ""big deal"" out of these details, I think: Denying '''Ævar''' admin status would be like telling a general that he doesn't have basic security clearance to be on base. Obviously, a general ''does'' have earned trust to do the most basic of things, exposing this logic as flawed. Therefore, I strongly support.--"

While I don't expect that EVERY user create a user page, our admins should definitely be expected to support the best practices on wikipedia, and I believe that a user page is one of those practices.

I believe that deleting one's own user talk page seriously undermines the transparency of the Wikipedia process. You could simply blank it, and ""purge"" it into the page history. With adminship, one is often dealing with users who do not understand the entire Wikipedia process due to their newness, stubbornness, intent to vandalize, etc. In answer to the image questions, you say that you'll go through the proper channels before deletion. But Ævar has shown to us quite recently by temporarily re-sysopping himself that he does not intend to constantly follow procedure.

Kate's tool isn't relevant here; I can count them by hand. They are a few V/AfD edits and not much else. One of them is a merge during an otherwise deleting AfD. This is allowed, per WP:BOLD, I very well know, but I don't like it being done since it renders all the other editor's opinions irrelevant, unless someone is going to un-merge after the AfD. I think only one or two of them were 'engaging' edits i.e. not actually discussing but just stating his opinion. This is fine, and what most people do in AfD, but some debating/discussing is essential to be able to see how an editor conducts themselves. So I think I'd like to see considerably more user and community interaction, just because there is too little on which to judge how Shaddack may respond when under pressure or in disgreement etc. Broaden your scope of participation a little, see which behind-the-scenes stuff you do/don't like and how it does/doesn't work. -"

Administrators must interact with the community and a user page is part of the face one presents. It need not be complex (mine was two short sentences for months), but administrators are trusted members with additional abilities and I feel they should make ''some'' effort to connect with the community by posting ''something''. Not to do somehow doesn't seem in the spirit of openness and transparency that I feel administrators should promote, especially regarding themselves. And it seems unprofessional. I also am concerned that Uncle G made no effort here to address this concern or even to explain why he thought it was irrelevant. Administrators should be sensitive to concerns regarding their behavior. However, I understand his lack of comment, as from his answer to question 1 and his comment on Radiant's talk page, it appears that adminship is not something he strongly wants nor is it very helpful to the types of activities he normally does. Of course, some would argue that the best administrators are those who aren't crazy about pursuing adminship, but between my perceived lack of benefit to him and the lack of a user page, it's enough to push me to oppose. If Uncle G wishes to stand out from everyone else, he is free to make his signature red or whatever he likes.  &mdash;"

The replies given on his talk page are so brief and brusque as to be on the thin edge of politeness, and one of them was only answered today despite being posted in April. One example says just ""never mind"" as a clear dismissal and others don't indicate a tendency to engage in a friendly manner. There's an alarming lack of use (and lack of proper use) of the edit summary, too and some odd choices over what constitutes major (e.g. inserting an image) and minor (e.g. removing a link), both of which could be controversial actions. Whilst I don't think golden prose maketh an admin, the selected pages on his user page are all stubs or slightly-more-than-stubs and I'd like to see ''some'' sort of deeper contribution. Finally, there is a very small amount of work in the Wikipedia: and talk: spaces and thus, I think, insufficient interaction in the more spiky parts of the 'pedia at the moment (esp. when coupled with the sparse, brusque talk page). This all sounds like I hate him despite not having 'met' him. I don't mean it like that at all; being the first 'oppose', I figured I should just be thorough.

The comment ""Because it's faster to make quick comments on IRC than it is to edit"" above makes me wonder where his focus is.

I don't think you're a bad person, the thought of you unblocking Amalekite never even crossed my mind. It's a matter of trusting your judgement - past experience says I shouldn't, and your present comments say that my past impression is still valid,"" and I share this view entirely.  That Haukur Þorgeirsson would respond to G by writing, ""The post was clearly silly, semi-delusional and in very bad taste - I don't contest any of that. The only thing I don't think is accurate is that the post represented a real life danger to the people behind the Wikipedia user names,"" is enough proof to me that, regardless of his intentions, Haukur is naive, reckless, and dangerous.  Above Matt Crypto writes that Haukur may have been offended as well as amused by Amalekite's posting (the fact that one of Haukur's supporters ''still'' doesn't actually know whether Haukur was offended or not itself speaks volumes).  But given Haukur's most recent statement, it wouldn't matter to me if he were offended as well as amused. Everyone has an excuse for being naive &mdash; that is just our state prior to knowledge.  I don't balme Haukur for initially not taking Stormfront seriously, we all make mistakes.  But for him to disregard the postings of several well-informed and responsible editors, for him to ''resist'' learning something new takes us from naivete to irresponsibility.  And no, Matt Crypto, I am not trying to punish someone who has in other ways been a good contributer because he took an ''unpopular'' stance.  Even if the stance were popular, I would still object.  It has nothing to do with it being popular or unpopular.  It was a reckless and thoughtless stance regarding a very serious matter."

Originally I honestly came here with intent to vote Support or not vote at all.  But I decided to read through the entire discussion.

Ævar, you state about deleting your user talk page that ""when it's large and all the discussions on it are old, it's my way of archiving it.""  Ævar, I recognize we may have a language barrier and I do not wish to put you unfairly on the spot, but do you know the exact definition of the word ""archive""?  Archive does not mean ""get rid of.""  It means something more akin to ""put in storage, out of the way, but still accessible for retrieval if necessary.""  '''Deleting''' a page absolutely does not in any way archive it.  Moving it archives it.  Copying it elsewhere archives it.  I'll even accept that blanking it archives it, because it is still accessible in the page history.  But you absolutely just cannot call deleting a page ""archiving"" it.  It '''is''' important for everything that has transpired on your talk page to be accessible to any interested lookers.  That is a very important and cherished Wikipedia tradition.  You just cannot glibly say ""I was archiving it"" without doing severe injustice to the meaning of the word and, mor importantly, your credibility on Wikipedia."

He did this without any prior discussion on the talk page. This created quite some pressure to start new articles for each and every program, which in turn are now accused being plain advertisement articles. He also quickly and boldly reverted my edit (adding external named links) without any attempt to discuss it or to consider my argumentation or presenting arguments himself. The list itself now has no info besides the names of the programs (in the form of internal links to mostly non-existing articles) and some unnamed external links (which are deemed very bad style according to [[Wikipedia:How to edit a page]]) - but he only tolerates these on entries for which no article exists.

You want to be an admin (you accepted the nom), but doubt you'll have time to do admin things? Why do you need the tools then? The things you say you'd like to spend time on do not need admin tools. Use of edit summaries is a touch lower than I like to see (59% overall, 76% over last 500 edits), and activity level is a bit lower than I like to see (7 edits a day over last 90 days, and that average has been slowly but steadily dropping for the last six months). Your intention of beginning a PhD program means this average will drop further. Also, I am a bit concerned about possible overuse on your part of the {{tl|fairuse}} tag on various images that you have uploaded. About 1/4 of the images you've uploaded have been tagged with this tag, which really shouldn't be used if possible. Lastly, 352 of your last 500 edits have been marked as minor. Are you perhaps over-using the minor edit box?

Vikreykja did revert a good-faith edit of mine with ""reverting vandalism"", which wasn't very nice. All I'd done was shift wikilinking from an archive content list (which remained) to a floating box at the top right. Vikreykja also threatened to RfC me. However, I was indeed heavy-handed in threatening to block Vikreykja if he continued that sort of thing, so his reaction is more understandable and I do not hold it against him. Everyone makes mistakes. Besides, I'd completely forgotten about this 'conflict' until it was pointed out to me today. I couldn't believe it when CryptoDerk told me I'd flatly threatened to block a user - I like to think it's not my style. So I'm not too proud of it either. Anyway, I'm not voting support or oppose on this RfA because I don't have any more experience than that in dealing with this user. Those who have interacted with Vikreykja more often and more recently are better equipped to decide if he is fit for adminship.

Evilphoenix,Beau99,-1,-1,2005,"07:19, 20 October 2005","'''Oppose'''. Ok this turned into quite the speech, but I want to be clear on my reasoning. My general baseline is four months and 2,000 edits. However, I'm willing to bend that in cases where one of those being stronger makes up for one being less, particularly on the time side, or in cases where I know the user well enough to get a sense of their suitability. However, I have not had any opportunity to interact with you, and I generally am strongly disinclined to support with anything less than 1,000 edits. Considering that that number is also over a year-long period, that shows a level of participation that I do not think is enough for adminship. Part of why I feel that way is I am concerned that with infrequent participation, you may not be able to keep up with policy. This came up in another user's RfA recently, and in that case I felt confident with both that user's participation level and attention level to policy. However, I note a couple things in your RfA: First, you use the term ""Votes for Deletion"". VfD has in the past few months been re-named ""Articles for Deletion"". I myself am still getting used to that change, but I have a hard time being convinced you will be able to know policy well with that kind of error. Second, your user signature does not seem to link to your user page. I believe it is important for an admin to have a clear signature that easily links to both their user and talk pages, to facilitate communication. Third, you describe in your answers to the questions below that you would attempt to resolve disputes off-site. I question the wisdom of this. One of the advantages that we have with the wiki process is that ''everything'' is completely transparent. Nothing that we do on this site is hidden, and every edit, comment, and action is reviewable, and for the most part, reversable. If you attempt conflict resolution offsite, there is absolutely no evidence of what transpired. Having that evidence is helpful in that it may serve to protect you, should you be wrongly accused of mis-action by another user. Also, in your introduction, you state that you have more edits than you can count, which in my first read made me think that you were claiming to have a large edit count, however that is not the case. I am sure that was not intentional, but I want you to be aware of the impression that I got. I'm sorry this is such a soapbox, but I like to be clear in my reasoning. I hope that you will continue to provide an excellent contribution to the project. Best regards,"

Those who aren't, maybe not.  (Imagine me as the welcomer.  About as cuddly as a caltrop.)  Some people should tag images.  Some shouldn't.

Sjakkalle,Uncle G,0,1,2005,,"I supported Uncle G last time, but there is one situation since then where I feel his conduct was more stubborn than I would like to see from an administrator. The situation was the deletion/undeletion saga of [[Mahajana High School]]. It was originally VFDed under the name [[Maha Jana High School]], where there was a no consensus result, however Uncle G left a late vote that this school didn't exist and the closing admin, paying attention to this, decided to replace the article with a redirect which was deleted a few weeks later. During the undeletion debate and subsequent VFD debate, Uncle G got into some lively exchanges with Tony Sidaway where Uncle G continued to insist that the school didn't exist, in spite of evidence to the contrary (whether the school was named ""Mahajana"" or ""Maha Jana"" should have been beside the point.) The relevant debates are [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Maha Jana High School]], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_undeletion&oldid=13552510#Maha_Jana_High_School the undeletion debate], and [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Mahajana High School|the second VFD debate]].

Haukurth has not only proven to be willing to defend his views politely and completely in the face of withering criticism, and unlike several others here, he's also been very consistent in his view that adminship grants him no ''super special judgement powers'' to permanently ban or unban someone without a full discussion of all the issues involved.  His repeated expression of willingness to defer to the consensus view on Wikipedia is proof that he's already better at this than anyone could reasonably be expected to be in order to qualify for adminship.  Regarding the Amalekite issue, there is absolutely no excuse to deny adminship to someone for arguing their views politely and fully, as long as they've proven willing to yield to consensus in the end, which is '''''exactly''''' what Haukurth did.  Modesty in use of power, even in the hypothetical case, is to be commended.  Further, ''no single admin or admin candidate'' can ever be held responsible for being proactive in blocking an ""Amalekite2""; whichever admin first finds the threat to be credible will make the initial block, and then we'll have our discussion starting there.  We cannot deny adminship on the hypothetical that he wouldn't be the first.  <u>It is foolish to deny adminship based upon a hypothetical situation ''as if he would be the only admin on Wikipedia'' because we've never demanded admins all hold a single view on blocking; in fact, I ''thought'' (until I saw some of the opposition on this RfA) that we encouraged them to think for themselves...</u>"

An administrator has more responsibility and more autonomy associated with their account. For example, if one ""[burns] out quickly"" while performing RC patrol without administrative functions, I am inclined to feel they would not be used in an as refined and precise manner as they should be, when given. There is also a strong sense that critique is not handled as gracefully as they can be. Administrators often encounter situations which require diplomacy and more moderation; some of the responses presented at the moment do not seem to highlight adequately level-headedness and willingness to learn. Finally, there are many situations where one will need to evaluate based on introspection alone without external guidance. For example, what purpose did it serve to first use the words ""unclean"", ""dirty"", and ""wrong""? Certainly, they are somewhat intensifying modifiers and their reception and reaction to them should not be surprising. Respectfully,"

It's alarming though that we are to have a political test for editors, although again it's understandable that some want it. I don't feel it's fair that Haukur should be denied adminship though because he made a spirited defence of what he takes to be the values of Wikipedia. It's very sad that he is opposed for ''disagreeing with other editors'' but that's how it is here. You go with the herd or you're punished, and we're calling that ""consensus"" these days."

People put all sorts of things on their user pages, and shouldn't be limited to pictures of dogs and quotes from Hermann Hesse or Buckminster Fuller.  More importantly, Connolley did not come to Wikipedia in order to promote himself (e.g. through his user page); he has been an active contributor to articles covering topics he has knowledge of.  Isn't this the character of the ideal wikipedian?  Has he been in edit-disputes?  How many people here have not?  I actually think there is something at stake here.  We all want wikipedia to be open to all users, meaning, one need not have a PhD. in anthropology to write on an anthropological topic.  No one has ever disputed this.  But some people interpret this to mean that people who actually have demonstrable knowledge of an area should somehow be penalized for contributing to Wikipedia.  My vote is not only ''for'' Connolley, it is ''against'' those people who hate having their cherished views challenged by someone who knows more than they do."

The fact that he is closing AfDs is good, but he shouldn't be closing no-consensi because that's what admins are for, and trusting their judgement in such things is part of why we have RfA. ([[Wikipedia:Deletion process]] is also very clear on the matter; presumably the editor hasn't read this document.) I would like to see a convincingly firmer grip on procedure and policy, particularly in this area since he indicates interest in adminning it and its closely related deletion processes. I would also like more than a few hundred edits to judge consistency and style by (don't start on me). Also, anecdotally, Extreme Unction has only very recently come to my attention: at the risk of sounding self-centered, I see most good RfA candidates long before they turn up here and I was quite surprised to see his name and more surprised to see he is in fact clear of 3 months.

Redux has sometimes, but however repeatedly, made personal attacks and used abusive foul language. And Redux has repeatedly made accusations of sockpuppetry when he must have understood that there were no more than one username in use (he ''then'' tried to fabricate an allegation of another username, baselessly). Redux has shown himself a possessive nature - one of the examples is him putting a WIP tag into an article, keeping it days (also continued when reminded that the tag is intended for only 30-180 minutes, not longer), and reversed a valid edit by another, when such had been made over half a day after Redux' installation of WIP tag.

There are a few comments there, but nothing that would rise to the level of the significant conflict resolution I was hoping to see.  Because I have yet to see how Gator1 would handle himself in another partisan conflict, I must officially vote oppose.  I was reluctant to bring up specific diffs from the past because he seems to be doing a fine job these days, but I fear that others voting yes have not adequately assessed the past situation.  Gator1 may have been defending someone as a knee-jerk reaction to feeling he was ""ganged up on,"" but the manner in which he did it was not all right for any editor much less an administrator.  I would be reluctant to support someone for admin with this short amount of time on Wikipedia regardless of who they were; combined with this past incident it makes it impossible for me to support.

You've been here since 2003, and you have 1300+ edits, and hardly anything in namespaces other than the main namespace. Please explain with a valid reason why you have a diparity in distribution wrt time. Since you contribute in the main namespace I have some questions: I've checked your upload log, but I still need some answers, how well do you know about image copyrights? Do you know the correct formats to use? It seems to me that you don't know anything about [[Fair use]] and copyrights. Can you prove me wrong?  I also checked out the [[Mohegan Sun]] article. Do you know wikipedia's target audience? The article is slightly larger than a stub; why do like the article so much? Are you aware that driving directions are not considered encyclopedic?"

He's written all of these articles on regular-season cricket matches that are much better suited for Wikinews (and I've told him this on VfD discussions for those), yet he and the other cricket editors insist on keeping them here, when that level of detail in covering a cricket season is not really that necessary in this wiki.

Placing this in juxtaposition of the [[Rod Strickland]] article created by you with redlinks ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rod_Strickland&diff=prev&oldid=26279859]), your handling of redlinks seems very unusual, and perhaps too casual. I am also concerned about the removal of [[Abdul Kalam]] from [[21st century]] labeled as ""Reverted POV"" in edit summary ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=21st_century&diff=prev&oldid=26240043]). This person is the president of the 2nd largest (by population) country in the world. I have a hard time understanding how inclusion on a list of influential people in politics could be considered POV pushing. Dr. Kalam is still missing from that list. More care in deletions is needed; your impact here was negative and ongoing. There's also a curious deletion of content on the [[Nelly]] article ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nelly&diff=prev&oldid=26224711]). The edit summary says only ""revert"". The content deleted is very similar to the line right above it in the version where it was not yet deleted ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nelly&diff=prev&oldid=26223194]). On what grounds did you delete the content? I also have some mild objections to improper stub sorting ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Girvan_Dempsey&diff=prev&oldid=26313685], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kelly_%28U.S._politician%29&diff=prev&oldid=27022545]) which was later corrected by others ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Girvan_Dempsey&diff=next&oldid=26313685], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kelly_%28U.S._politician%29&diff=next&oldid=27022545]), and improper speedy tagging of [[Lenny and Squiggy]] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lenny_and_Squiggy&oldid=26314158]) which I feel was premature, and was corrected a few hours later ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lenny_and_Squiggy&diff=26324526&oldid=26314158]). If you're not familiar with a topic, you should be careful before tagging it, much less speedy deleting it. Any of these things by themselves would not be sufficient for me to vote oppose. But, taken as a whole, I feel there is a pattern of behavior that shows the nominee to be too quick to judge, and less careful than needed for an administrator. I do feel the nominee's heart is in the right place. Given improvement in carefulness of their approach to deletions of articles and content and a few months time, I may be inclined to support. --"

Ruy Lopez,Eequor (2nd),-1,-1,2005,"19:29, 22 Jun 2005","'''Oppose'''.  There is an idea brewing among supporters that she has mended her ways since her (failed) nomination seven months ago.  I do not agree.  Looking back to six months ago we can see one of Eequor's typical inflammatory edits[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2004/Candidate_statements/Endorsements/Sam_Spade&diff=8009399&oldid=8009258] where she removed all comments in opposition to Sam Spade's ArbCom nomination.  To be fair, I have to say she removed Sam Spade's one supporter along with fifteen of his detractors.  I do agree with the supporters who say [[re-education]] is possible, and a bad editor can become a good editor, perhaps even one who can one day be an admin.  But I do not think a few weeks is good enough.  For me to support Eequor's nomination, I think more time has to pass, I think she needs to show she is making a contribution to Wikipedia and not stirring up a hornet's nest (as she has done in the past, many times), and I think she needs to convince people she has turned over a new leaf.  Not enough time, nor effort, has passed for her to be considered admin material.  Just six months ago, she was mass deleting the comments on fifteen users for a matter I was concerned with, Sam Spade's ArbCom nomination, and she was wrecking havoc in other areas more recent than that - five months ago vandalizing Astrochicken[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astrochicken&diff=9033071&oldid=9032779] and so forth.  A few weeks of calming down is not good enough, more time, and more effort are needed.

Avoiding conflict when dealing with a topic like global warming over a long period of time is almost impossible, so that there have been some conflicts should not in itself be a criterion of exclusion. Conflict avoidance is a valid strategy, but if all good users avoided conflicts, then any aggressive user who wants to promote a certain ideology could easily do so. I don't believe William is likely to abuse his sysop privileges (nor that, if he did, it would actually help him), I do think he now understands and will try to follow 3RR, and I get the impression that his behavior is generally reasonable and sane, if perhaps a bit confrontational. I do believe William genuinely understands his edits to be a valid interpretation of NPOV policy, particularly the section on pseudoscience, with its remarks on proportional representation and clear attribution. I don't think a disagreement among reasonable people over what is and isn't NPOV can or should be grounds for denying adminship. I will apply the same standard to people from the opposite point of view, of course.

We have a number of editors whose contributions dwarf mine (Tony is likely one of these) but who don't have an admin temperament, and I think they should be valued but not promoted.  That said, I don't know Tony well enough to be sure about this, so I won't oppose, and certainly many people whose judgment I trust support his nomination, so perhaps I am simply jumping to a wrong conclusion.

I've also had a brief spin through his recent contributions.  Tony strikes me as a generally quality Wikipedian, whose opinions I often do not share, but whose fundamental commitment to this site is easily the equal of mine.  I cannot, therefore, do anything but support him -- I would caution him to be very self-aware about areas where his strong opinions may cloud his judgment (and to be careful when dealing with ""semi-policies""), but that's good advice for anybody, and shouldn't pose a serious obstacle to his being a productive admin.

I, for one, trust in him enough that he will do well with it. It's time to move on: mistakes happen, and it's pointless to keep a man in the mud after an apology and a promise not to do it again."

Other such lists has previously been made, and one of the more well-known is the ""Elders of Wikipedia"", made by a member of the NAZI ""Stormfront"" website. Admins should be a good example to everybody else here, and I can't recommend that we start to make lists of users that we don't appriciate, in places where they can't respond to the criticism that is being raised against them. --"

My advice: become more civil in your use of the English language, learn more new words in the language to help self-expression, and ''learn from more experienced, respected editors'' here on the Wikipedia.  Find an area of interest you don't know much about (other than bands and music) and learn and contribute to it.  '''Then''' come back and see about adminship.

She agressively reverted my edits despite disccusion on the talk page where I was trying to point out the scientific errors she was making in her edits. She finally accused me of making personal attacks because I refused to agree with her interpretation. It took A LOT of discussion to persuade her that her edits were factual errors.  I find it worrying that an editor can be so strong willed when they are editing material for which they do not have a strong grasp. I suggest that rather than digging in and fighting she should review her position if challeneged with reasonable rebuttals. If this had been a one off incident it would not be a problem but her strong personality is coming out on this page too. The many 3RR offenses are unacceptable. On the positive side when she is making edits that agree with consensus she does a good job.  She also makes valuable contributions on the [[Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Science]]. I doubt my oppose vote will stop her becoming an admin but i am still going to vote this way since I hope Natalina will look at her previous actions and learn to be less of a ''bull in a china shop'' when other editors disagree with her.

If you go through ''all'' of this user's edits and diffs (as I have done) you will find that this user is thoroughly conscientious, courteous, and consistent. Many of his contributions are mature, well thought out, and extensive. There are hardly any spelling mistakes; I consider this indicative of one who acts with care, deliberation, and precision. Although there are currently concerns that this user has not contributed to a variety of namespaces, I don't think this should necessarily be a concern here. Based on his edit history, I am confident that none of the administrative functions will be used by this user unless it is essential to the task at hand - whatever that might be. This user also seems to be very well adapted to resolving chronic, subtle problems on Wikipedia - those which take an exceptional amount of time and effort to see through to completion. Perhaps his interests at the moment are different from what I think of as a stereotypical ""front line administrator"" (one who deals primarily with RC patrol on a daily basis, for example) but sometimes I think we require a diversity of administrative and interpersonal skills on Wikipedia, and so I feel he would be a good fit to the community in this regard. --"

My only reasons for opposing are his activity level per day being lower than I normally find acceptable, and his edit summary usage is lower than I like to see. If someone is going to delist this RfA, I suggest coming up with better grounds than editcountitis for doing so. An RfA is useful for instructing a nominee on how they should improve to become a better nominee in the future. So far, the oppose votes are speaking just one lesson. Let this RfA stand.

Antaeus Feldspar,Zappaz,-1,-1,2005,"01:42, 10 September 2005","'''Strongest possible oppose!'''  Zappaz has shown over and over basic untrustworthiness -- I would point you at the sordid fiasco of [[Hate groups and new religious movements]] for perhaps the prime example.  Zappaz kept trying to insert into [[Hate group]] the fact that [[Elan Vital]] claims the former members it calls ""ex-premies"" are a hate group.  Other editors such as myself believe the material should be removed, because nothing about that fact really illuminates the subject of hate groups in general.  At one point in the editing, Zappaz finds himself at his limit of three reverts: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hate_group&diff=8405205&oldid=8402318], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hate_group&diff=8406184&oldid=8406081], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hate_group&diff=8406726&oldid=8406713].  So what does he do?  Does he respect the spirit as well as the letter of the three-revert rule?  No -- with his very next edit, he [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hate_group&diff=8408001&oldid=8406847 creates a new article on the spot], starting it with a cut-and-paste of [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hate_groups_and_new_religious_movements&direction=prev&oldid=8406786 ''his'' preferred version] of the section under dispute.  Do we really need an editor who will look for new, sneakier ways to game the system?  For a further illustration of why this editor cannot be trusted, read the arguments he made during the above revert war, that ""if any other organization, controversial or not, (church, NRM, group, etc.) makes a substantial point of calling another organization or group a ""hate group"" and publish that in their literature, then definitively it should be mentioned in this article as well"", and compare with his comments in a recent [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/List_of_purported_cults/2&diff=prev&oldid=19438243 VfD] about how a list article is too POV and deserves deletion because the items of the list are ""a one sided POV expressed"".  If you find yourself tempted to vote for Zappaz because at one point you saw him (supposedly) disregarding POV to act on principle, take a closer look at his history and you'll probably see him upholding the ''opposite'' principle when that's what suits his ends.  Wikipedia needs admins with integrity enough not to abuse their power.  For that reason it ''doesn't'' need Zappaz as an admin. --"

If a new user tries to game the system, tries to holler his way to a ""keep,"" or tries to play the ""I'm just a blushing flower whose soul will be crushed if this is deleted,"" then we ought be quite unconcerned.  Anyone who will fold after a VfD, whose petals will be crushed, is not going to manage very well in a place where no one gets to own his or her own words.  We don't cease to be a wiki- or an encyclopedia because of the subjective state of the authors and editors. R. fiend has been exemplary in trying to make the system better (working on deletion reform, working in policy, trying to solve edit wars and conflicts) as well as the encyclopedia better (writing as well as voting, contributing as well as tinkering).

It is worthwhile to note that these are some of Allen3's earlier contributions. This for me is indicative of Allen3's dedicated approach towards Wikipedia. I do not feel the small number of written contributions made to articles an adequate or sufficient reason to deny Allen3 the opportunity to engage in Wikipedia's administrative matters. Based on the contributions made by Allen3 to date, if Allen3 were to become an administrator, I trust Allen3 to be an exemplary, mature, levelheaded, and respected one. Finally, I have no doubt the trust and support we are demonstrating here will be positively reciprocated many times over if administrative rights have been enabled for this user.

There are already some gruff administrators (even, dare I say it, bureaucrats), and the pedia is the better for them. Polite, explicitly expressed consideration can take a lot of time; all admins have to make some effort but not all must be very good at this; a certain degree of gruffness is OK if it gives more time for people like Rfiend to do more good work.

One of the reasons for this is the user's lack of experience on the Wikipedia; I am by no way questioning the quality of his edits, but he still needs more time in activity to qualify as an admin. Secondly, and much more serious in my opinion, is the way the user has let other editors defend him during this RfA, instead of giving clean answers to editors who questioned his actions. [[User:Ed Poor|Ed Poor]]'s disappearance after the initial nomination also leaves me with doubts. Thus, I oppose to this user not due to his merit - or lack of - as an editor, but by the way he has reacted and by the events that lead to this RfA. Will likely support in case he is nominated once more in the future. --"

It hardly ever happens; so if an admin so misbehaves as to be required by the AC to go through RFA again, and 22 people oppose it after having had an opportunity to observe the person in action as an administrator, I am not sure that person should ever be an admin again, or if so, it should be after a much longer period of redemption than two or three months and a relatively small number of edits.   I wouldn't assume that a person would mature very much in three months; so I would really want to have seen a lot of good edits in stressful situations to feel that trust in him as an admin was again warranted.  If the slate was wiped clean after the de-sysop, he should at least show as much good activity as a new user who joined the site that day would be required to have in order to be supported on RFA --- as if, for example, he had simply created a new account and had been working all this time to establish a new persona.

After perusing Kate's Tool, looking at the classification of edits, looking at his (yes, you're a he!) user page/user talk page, and looking at a (judicious) sampling of his edits over the last few months, I have come to the conclusion that [[User:Jwrosenzweig|Jwrosenzweig]] is correct.  This is an editor that not only knows how to rewrite and expand articles (a complex task at times) but owns up to prior mistakes in article entries (and corrects them himself).  He reverts obvious vandalism on sight when he sees it, and gives room for not knowing everything about a topic (thinking gray: see my own user page for context). To top it off, he has a very ''delightful'' sense of humor.  Just because he is more interested in adding article content does not mean he does not know how to interact well with other editors (I've checked that too).  Admins are ''trusted'' members who happen to have a set of tools at their disposal, not ''perfect'' or ''all-encompassing'' folks who participate in everything. . . I know I as an editor here follow my own fields of interest, as does TSB.  I see no reason ''not'' to promote him to Administrator status.  He's been trustworthy to date. . . and he, I believe, will be trustworthy with the Admin buttons.  Correcting the [[William Shakespeare]] article for his correct signature - the one from his will - is the icing on the cake for me.

Sherurcij edited a number of mistakes into the article (factual, spelling, and grammar) and insisted that using an image of Tanweer about to board a train before blowing himself up was POV, which was bizarre given that [[Scotland Yard]] had confirmed Tanweer was one of the bombers. Sherurcij also fiercely opposed saying in the intro how many had died overall in the bombing (56 dead, 700 wounded), arguing that Tanweer should be associated only with the number he had actually killed (7), even though the police had confirmed the four bombers acted as part of a joint enteprise, and that it was a matter of chance exactly how many each man had actually killed. (And in fact, in his first preferred version, he didn't even want the number of people Tanweer had killed directly to be mentioned until the very last paragraph. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shehzad_Tanweer&diff=18995997&oldid=18993971]) He also uploaded a number of images without tagging and sourcing them, and even though he was warned they'd be deleted and was asked to find the source (I offered to find the right tag if he would just tell me where he'd found them), he ignored the queries, and the images were of course deleted, then he didn't go back to delete the red links. All in all, it was irresponsible editing, in my view. See [[Talk:Shehzad_Tanweer#Reverting]] until the end of the page, and here's his first revert of my edits, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shehzad_Tanweer&diff=19038829&oldid=19037923] where he has a brief intro saying Tanweer is a suspect (even though the police had already confirmed), but with no details until the very end of the article, and with odd writing like ""his suspected death.""

If more editors had that passion, Wikipedia would be a better encyclopedia.

Scottperry,Zappaz,-1,-1,2005,,"'''Oppose for now.''' I have been a Wiki editor for approximately 3 years, and was also once (20+ years ago) a student of user Zappaz's current spiritual teacher, Prem Rawat.  Also, I was the original founder of the organization ex-premies.org, towards which Zappaz appears to be most animately opposed, but which I have not been active in for approximately 10 years.  Zappaz's very first article-text edit shows him deleting a critical link to his spiritual teacher at [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prem_Rawat&diff=prev&oldid=4524031 Zappaz's first article-text edit].  For this deletion his only editorial explanation was: ''Maharaji in the Press - rv - not relevant to section''.  The section that the link appeared in was the external links section.  Does this mean that to Zappaz, any criticism of his spiritual teacher is ''inappropriate''?  This does not seem to me to be consistent with Wiki NPOV policy.  In Zappaz's last major article-text edit, again he did not appear to be following standard Wiki policy.  This was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Prem_Rawat&diff=22782383&oldid=22747336 Zappaz's last major article-text edit on 09/07].  In this major edit, he inserted reams of undocumented assertions, presenting all of these as fact, all apparently aimed at undermining any potential criticism of Prem Rawat.  In this edit he also again erased critical external links, such as the link: [http://www.geocities.com/maharajiwd/ Gateway webpage] explaining this deletion with the cryptic comment, ''mv to refs''.  All of these edits seem to me to show that Zappaz somehow places the priority of his need to defend the reputation of Prem Rawat over the need to let the simple facts plainly speak for themselves.  When Zappaz demonstrates the understanding that in Wiki facts should always be allowed to speak more loudly than personal agendas, consistently demonstrating this over a significant period of time, then I will gladly support his nomination if asked, but not sooner. -"

We don't need a trigger-happy deletionist to ""''wipe Wikipedia clean''"", ""''deal with''"" new users, and block the authors of articles that meet CSD, as he promises to do in his first answer. I'd rather go with a candidate who wants to save articles and guide new users."

David 5000,Hedley,-1,-1,2005,"08:08, 2 Jun 2005","'''Oppose'''. Before anyone dismisses this as simply being vindictive, please read to the end, my opposition is based on more than the vandalism incident.  As has already been discussed, Hedley and I (and others) were involved in a game on the CoolClarity message boards - both of us made two or three vandalisms, nothing more.  About a month later I found that I had been blocked, after Hedley decided that he needed to drop someone else in it to save his own skin.  This is the text of a private message that I received from him on the CoolClarity message board on 20th March: ''""If you want to know the whole truth, in this PM, I was just trying to impress the big guns in the Wikipedia room by coming clean by adding Zakir Raman to VfD. When I supplied them the info on the link to here, they noticed you and I guess I spoke to some strict admins about it because they put you up on the RfC. I don't intentionally mean to grass anyone up, but I wasn't gonna say that on Wikipedia.. Thing is, I didn't want to get a block, so I was defending myself. No intention to be hostile toward you or anything, but I was stuck in a situation where it was defend you and get blocked, or go on the side of the admins and come away fairly clean..""'' I don't think someone who is willing to twist the truth like that to further his own Wikipedia career is suitable to be an admin. My other objections revolve around the two occasions that I have encountered Hedley while making edits on here.  The first involves the page [[Nelson Piquet, Jr.]], which I created in October.  In March I was informed on [[User_talk:David_5000|my talk page]] by Hedley that ''""Hey, your article Nelson Piquet, Jr. was a duplicate of an existing article on him, so i've changed it to a redirect. You'll find there was an article of more depth already at Nelson Angelo Piquet.""''  Of course if you compare the history of both pages [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nelson_Piquet%2C_Jr.&action=history 1] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nelson_Angelo_Piquet&action=history 2] you'll see that Hedley was wrong: my page was there five months earlier - when I questioned him about this on his talk page I didn't receive a response.  The second issue is about the page for the racing driver [[Mathias Lauda]].  Hedley created the page with the incorrect title 'Matthias Lauda', but when I renamed the page he quickly reverted it to the incorrect version without checking whether he was correct.  Again my questions went unanswered.  These experiences make me think that <u>Hedley is inclined to make comments and edits without checking his facts first</u> - I'm concerned that Wikipedia would give moderator powers to someone who acts without checking whether his actions are justified first."

In Eequor's case, I'm hoping it will give her a bit more legitimacy, rather than the attitude I see here of dismissing her in thinly veiled ad hominem arguments.  I've seen some very disappointing things in this RFA from people for whom I have a lot of respect, and have seen few things about Eequor which worry me."
