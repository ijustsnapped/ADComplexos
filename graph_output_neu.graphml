to  believe that the path to recognition is by joining the project and jumping straight into maintenance areas with  both  feet.  \
With only 3 edits to  Wikipedia space he was transcluding his first RfA and he's been on my watchlist ever since.  Just  over a \
year ago  he was asked to  act with  more maturity, after which  he was indef banned from  the GA process (although this was later \
modified). I  was concerned over his unauthorised survey only 9 months ago, followed by the issues with his blocked alternative \
account. Problems with his use of AWB only 5 months ago followed by an application to be part of the RfBAG group gave me concern \
and only  3 months ago  he gets blocked for messing  about with bot business and appears to  blame the tools for his errors.  His \
50 most recent AfD !votes match the closures only 33.3% of the time, and his NAC just 24 days ago, reverted by  an admin  and closed \
by  another with  a different  conclusion,  was far too  complex for ''any'' NAC.  Having  !voted on  45  RfAs (matched the end \
result only 54.5% of the time) and reading all  the advice pages, he should have been aware that this call  for office is very  \
much too soon. Although tutored by our [[User",

to have and I'm not sure that you show the level of maturity required for that.  Second, I disagree with your response to question \
16.  I believe the clarity of the personal attack is less intense than you say it is.  Sure, the editor wasn't completely civil, \
and did stray off the content and onto the contributor but in a relatively minor way.  The worst part of the statement was the reference \
to autism; however, if you notice he stated \"like everyone else who runs bots\" making it slightly more of a statement on people \
who run bots.  Now, I am not saying it wasn't a personal attack at all, I am just trying to point out that it wasn't a ''major'' \
personal attack.  Continuing on, you stated you would leave a \"strong, personal warning\" on the talk page of the editor who left \
the attack.  That will do nothing but inflame the issue.  In a case like this, it would probably be best to ignore it and allow \

I get from Kudpung is that he brings a more static mindset to the project that is contrary to the ethos that has made Wikipedia \

his push for what he deems relevant questions at RfA on the surface seems commendable enough but it preempts serendipity and necessitates \
a presumption of knowing what is relevant and what is not and questioning the judgment of another editor.  Sometimes a little slack \
is required in a situation to give it room to sort itself out, I'm not sure Kudpung takes advantage of that as an option. I don'\

his adminship. <br />I would have opposed this RfA on the basis of that early AfD closure. For my money, we need to observe deletion \

I would also like to have seen a more robust response to the identified copyright concerns, and a more proactive approach to ensuring \

xbox is vastly superior to PS3, or that political party X is way better than political party Y; and this is a problematic approach \
that should be addressed wherever it is found. Since we do not have a mechanism for ensuring that editors themselves are reliable \

liked the identification of a responsibility to detect plagiarism, which has been a huge problem across the main page recently. \
But I think the candidate dodged the actual issue in the specific question. The article in question only has one real source so \
it would have been abundantly clear where the problem was without having to ask a follow-up question of the complainant. The other \
problem is the idea that non-reliable sources are less of a problem when they support \"non-contentious material\". What is contentious? \
How do we know? What to our unknowing eyes might be an innocent factoid might in fact be a highly contentious claim. For example \
the article says \"In the latter part of his life, Guha was accorded pension as a freedom fighter.\" \"Freedom fighter\" is an extremely \
value-laden word. This statement, like the rest of the article, is sourced to avowedly communist material that is fawning of the \
article's subject (\"Comrade Guha!\"). In my view, the article isn't fit to be on the mainspace, let alone the main page. I hope the \
candidate's refusal to say arose from RfA diplomacy rather than a genuine tolerance of the article. Anyway, I'm just throwing thoughts \
out for discussion and contemplation rather than rushing to a conclusion early in this RfA. My gut is much closer to supporting \
than opposing. DYK either needs to be (a) tanked; (b) overhauled; or (c) given an influx of qualified admins to help the current \

that criterion. In my view, that amounts to complete rejection of the criterion. Passing over the nomination for another admin to \

can properly be denied its exercise by an admin just because the admin is unsure of its application. I'm also unsure of the answer \

on each one of them. We obviously need editors to give third opinions, but if you do so much of it that your understanding of individual \

he needs several more months to detach himself from his checkered past. I have no reason to believe he would deliberately misuse \

historical records, a consistent track record is necessary to pass RfA. On a more down-to-earth level, I agree that you need to \
